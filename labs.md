# Labs

NANOx81 is evaluated via three labs.

Lab 1 - 25% of total grade
Lab 2 - 25% of total grade
Lab 3 - 50% of total grade

Labs 1 and 2 have already been posted. Lab 3 will be an open problem, i.e., even your instructors have no idea of 
the correct solution, and will be held as a Kaggle competition.
