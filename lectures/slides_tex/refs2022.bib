  abstract = {Carbonaceous materials, especially tetrahedral amorphous carbon (ta-C), can form complex functionalized surface structures and are thus promising candidates for applications in biomedical devices and electrochemistry. Functional groups at ta-C surfaces have been widely studied by spectroscopic techniques; however, interpretation of the experimental data is extremely difficult, especially in the case of X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS). The assignments of experimental XPS and XAS signals are normally based on references obtained from molecular or crystalline samples, which are simplified approximations for the far more complex amorphous structures. Here, we use extensive density functional theory (DFT) simulations to predict XAS and XPS signatures for carbon-based materials in more realistic environments, building on large data sets of structural models generated by a machine-learning (ML) interatomic potential. The results indicate clear signatures: individual fingerprint XAS spectra and distinctive XPS binding energy distributions, both in terms of center and broadness of the signal, for chemically different groups. The results point out what kind of structural information can and cannot be extracted with X-ray spectroscopy. This study will enable a deeper physicochemical understanding of experimental data and ultimately theory-based identification and quantification of functional groups in carbonaceous materials.},

These reactions comprise an exhaustive list of all possible thermodynamically stable ternary conversion reactions for these transition metal compounds. The reactions are calculated based on a library DFT energies of 291 compounds, including all transition metal silicides, phosphides and stannides found in the Inorganic Crystal Structure Database (ICSD). We screen our computational database for the most appealing anode properties based on gravimetric capacity, volumetric capacity, cell potential, and volume expansion when compared with graphitic carbon anodes. This high-throughput computational approach points towards several promising anode compositions with properties signifi cantly superior to graphitic carbon, including CoSi 2 , TiP and NiSi 2 .}

For decades it has been believed that lithium, the simplest metallic element, has a complicated ground-state crystal structure. Using synchrotron x-ray diffraction in diamond anvil cells and multiscale simulations with density functional theory and molecular dynamics, we show that the previously accepted martensitic ground state is metastable. The actual ground state is face-centered cubic (fcc). We find that isotopes of lithium, under similar thermal paths, exhibit a considerable difference in martensitic transition temperature. Lithium exhibits nuclear quantum mechanical effects, serving as a metallic intermediate between helium, with its quantum effect\{\$\textbackslash backslash\$textendash\}dominated structures, and the higher-mass elements.

For a wide range of lithium oxides we could thus model ion transport revealing significant differences to an earlier geometric approach. This novel BV-based force-field has then been applied to investigate a range of mixed conductors, focusing on cathode materials for lithium ion battery (LIB) applications to promote a systematic design of LIB cathodes that combine high energy density with high power density. To demonstrate the versatility of the new BV-based force field it is applied in exploring various strategies to enhance the power performance of safe low cost LIB materials including LiFePO4, LiVPO4F, LiFeSO4F, etc.},

A combination of these two approaches opened a way for a deeper understanding of ion transport, especially in amorphous solid electrolytes, where the lack of reliable structural information so far have impeded minute atomistic descriptions of transport mechanisms. In this paper, we discuss both the abilities and limitations of this new approach. Special emphasis is put on the requirements for the consistent determination of bond-valence parameters that as necessary reflect the bond softness. For a variety of Ag+ ion conducting glasses, we find, using bond softness sensitive bond-valence parameters, pathways for ion transport in the reverse Monte Carlo produced structural models of the glasses. From the volume fraction of these pathways, we are able to predict both the absolute value and the activation energy of the ionic conductivity. Simulations of ion transport as random walks within the bond-valence pathway network shed further light on the transport process and provide a complementary way to predict the conductivity from structural models. ?? 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

In most of the cases, an electric field is applied to a two terminal dielectric material device and leads to the formation of a low resistance filament due to ion migration. However, the stochastic nature of the ion migration can be an impediment for the device robustness and controllability, with uncontrolled variations of high and low resistance states or threshold voltages. Here, we report an optically induced resistive switching based on a CdS/V3O5 heterostructure which can overcome this issue. V3O5 is known to have a second order insulator to metal transition around Tc \% 415 K, with an electrically induced threshold switching at room temperature. Upon illumination, the direct transfer of the photoinduced carriers from the CdS into V3O5 produces a nonvolatile resistive switching at room temperature. The initial high resistance can be recovered by reaching the high temperature metallic phase, i.e., temperatures above Tc. Interestingly, this resistive switching becomes volatile around the Tc. By locally manipulating the volatile and nonvolatile resistive switching using electric field and light, this system is a promising platform for hardware based neuromorphic computing implementations.},

Here, we employ first-principles molecular dynamics simulations to explore the interplay among chemistry, structure, and functionality of a highly conductive Li+ solid electrolyte, Li3InBr6. Using local-orbital projections to dynamically track the evolution of the electronic charge density, the simulations reveal rapid, correlated fluctuations between cation-anion interactions with different degrees of directional covalent character. These chemical bond dynamics are shown to correlate with Li+ mobility and are enabled thermally by intrinsic frustration between the preferred geometries of chemical bonding and lattice symmetry. We suggest that the fluctuating chemical environment from the polarizable anions functions like a solvent, contributing to the superionic behavior of Li3InBr6 by temporarily stabilizing configurations favorable for migrating Li+. The generality of these conclusions for understanding solid electrolytes and key factors governing the superionic phase transition is discussed.},

We present two new algorithms for solving this problem that are fundamentally di erent from the known algo- rithms. Empirical evaluation shows that these algorithms outperform the known algorithms by factors ranging from three for small problems to more than an order of mag- nitude for large problems. We also show how the best features of the two proposed algorithms can be combined into a hybrid algorithm, called AprioriHybrid. Scale-up experiments show that AprioriHybrid scales linearly with the number of transactions. AprioriHybrid also has ex- cellent scale-up properties with respect to the transaction size and the number of items in the database.},

  abstract = {A piezoelectric material is one that generates a voltage in response to a mechanical strain (and vice versa). The most useful piezoelectric materials display a transition region in their composition phase diagrams, known as a morphotropic phase boundary, where the crystal structure changes abruptly and the electromechanical properties are maximal. As a result, modern piezoelectric materials for technological applications are usually complex, engineered, solid solutions, which complicates their manufacture as well as introducing complexity in the study of the microscopic origins of their properties. Here we show that even a pure compound, in this case lead titanate, can display a morphotropic phase boundary under pressure. The results are consistent with first-principles theoretical predictions, but show a richer phase diagram than anticipated; moreover, the predicted electromechanical coupling at the transition is larger than any known. Our results show that the high electromechanical coupling in solid solutions with lead titanate is due to tuning of the high-pressure morphotropic phase boundary in pure lead titanate to ambient pressure. We also find that complex microstructures or compositions are not necessary to obtain strong piezoelectricity. This opens the door to the possible discovery of high-performance, pure-compound electromechanical materials, which could greatly decrease costs and expand the utility of piezoelectric materials.},

These atomistic simulation techniques, such as first-principles calculations and molecular dynamics allow atomistic-level resolution of structure, defect configuration, and energetics. Following the structure\textendash property paradigm, such understandings can be useful for guiding the design of high-performance HEAs. Although there have been a number of atomistic studies on HEAs, there is no comprehensive review on the state-of-the-art techniques and results of atomistic simulations of HEAs. This article is intended to fill the gap, providing an overview of the state-of-the-art atomistic simulations on HEAs. In particular, we discuss how atomistic simulations can elucidate the nanoscale mechanisms of plasticity underlying the outstanding properties of HEAs, and further present a list of interesting problems for forthcoming atomistic simulations of HEAs.},

The first principles simulations are in good agreement with the structural analyses reported in the literature for these materials and the computed total energies indicate that both materials are stable with respect to decomposition into binary and ternary products. The computational results suggest that both materials are likely to form metastable interfaces with Li metal. The simulations also find both materials to have Li ion migration activation energies comparable or smaller than those of related Li ion electrolyte materials. Specifically, for Li7PN4, the experimentally measured activation energy can be explained by the migration of a Li ion vacancy stabilized by a small number of O2-ions substituting for N3-ions. For Li14P2O3N6, the activation energy for Li ion migration has not yet been experimentally measured, but simulations predict it to be smaller than that measured for Li7PN4.},

To help understand the physics of the Li/oxygenbattery we present the first physics-based model that incorporates themajor thermodynamic, transport, and kinetic processes. We obtain a goodmatch between porous-electrode experiments and simulations by using an empiricalfit to the resistance of the discharge products (which includecarbonates and oxides when using carbonate solvents) as a functionof thickness that is obtained from flat-electrode experiments. The experimentsand model indicate that the discharge products are electronically resistive,limiting their thickness to tens of nanometers and their volumefraction in one of our discharged porous electrodes to afew percent. Flat-electrode experiments, where pore clogging is impossible, showpassivation similar to porous-electrode experiments and allow us to concludethat electrical passivation is the dominant capacity-limiting mechanism in ourcells. Although in carbonate solvents Li2O2 is not the dominantdischarge product, we argue that the implications of this model,(i.e., electrical passivation by the discharge products limits the capacity)also apply if Li2O2 is the discharge product, as itis an intrinsic electronic insulator. \textcopyright 2011 The Electrochemical Society},

In order to examine the usability of the method, I present here two examples: metallic Al and insulating MgO. The phonons of these two materials are calculated using density functional theory. The small displacement method results are compared with those obtained using the linear response method. In the case of Al the method provides accurate phonon frequencies everywhere in the Brillouin Zone (BZ). In the case of MgO the longitudinal branch of the optical phonons near the centre of the BZ is incorrectly described as degenerate with the two transverse branches, because the non-analytical part of the dynamical matrix is ignored here; however, thermodynamic properties like the Helmholtz free are essentially unaffected.}

  abstract = {We report a comprehensive thermodynamic analysis of thermal oxidation-reduction cycles for producing hydrogen that use metal ferrites with the spinel structure (MFe2O4; M ) Fe, Co, Ni, and Zn) as the redox material. Solution phases (both solid and liquid) were included in the calculations as well as the expected line compounds. Omitting solution phases, whose existence is experimentally well-documented, has a very significant impact upon the results of the calculations. Thermodynamic modeling of the three important material-related aspects of the process was performed, including synthesis of the ferrite materials from bulk oxides, thermal reduction at high temperatures, and reoxidation by reaction with steam. An experimental investigation of the NixFe3-xO4 system was performed to provide compositional data for comparison to model predictions. The results indicate that the Fe/Ni ratio, thermal reduction reaction kinetics, and the specifics of the cooling process affect the composition of the synthesized material. In particular, the presence of oxygen in the atmosphere during the cooling period following calcination substantially alters the sample composition. Predicted compositions following thermal reduction indicate that the stabilities are Fe3O4 \textbackslash textgreater CoFe2O4 {$\sim$} NiFe2O4 \textbackslash textgreater ZnFe2O4 and that the zinc-substituted ferrite is less desirable for solar hydrogen generation because of the high vapor pressure of zinc. Finally, modeling of the water oxidation step shows that efficient reoxidation to the original ferrite is thermodynamically feasible in all cases. We conclude that the temperature history and level of background O2 present will affect both the phase purity of the initially formed material and the stability of the composition over the course of thermal cycling.}

Detailed local environment investigations reveal that the formation of oxygen vacancies within and beyond the firstshell environment of Eu2+ is responsible for the redshift and broadening of the emission spectra via geometrical alteration of the Eu2+ local environment.

Using ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations, we demonstrate for the first time that TQ under the crossover mechanism is related to the local environment stability of the activator. Further, by accounting for the effect of the crystal field on the thermal ionization barrier, we show that a unified model can predict the experimental TQ in 29 known phosphors to within a root-mean-square error of {$\sim$}3.1-7.6\%.

It thus changes the view on the role of electronic interaction in these systems and opens the way to fast calculations of structural properties in actinides metallic system. We use ab initio values of effective Coulomb interactions and underline that Hund's exchange and spin\textendash orbit coupling are of utmost importance in these calculations. Secondly, we show that phonons properties in {$\delta$} plutonium are impacted by strong interactions. The GGA+DMFT results exhibits a lattice instability for the transverse (1 1 1) phonon mode. Moreover the amplitude of this lattice instability is consistent with the experimental temperature of stability of this phase. Our calculation thus shows that when the {$\delta$} phase is thermodynamically unstable (at 0 K), it is also dynamically unstable.},

Among these is the existence ofan end member CoO2 phase on complete lithium deintercalation. Theuse of dry plastic lithium-ion battery technology has allowed theconstruction of an in situ x-ray diffraction cell which allowsstructural characterization of LixCoO2 at x values at and closeto 0 for the first time. Instead of the expecteddestruction of the core structure of LiCoO2 by a drasticincrease in structural disorder, an increase in crystallographic quality occurredas x approached 0. For the first time, the endmember CoO2 phase was isolated. This phase is a hexagonalsingle-layered phase (O1) believed to be isostructural with CdI2 andhas lattice parameters of a = 2.822 \textbackslash AA and c= 4.29 \textbackslash AA. The phase converted immediately back to athree-layer (O3) delithiated LixCoO2 type phase on lithium reinsertion. Electrochemicalstudies show that 95\% of lithium can be reinserted backinto the structure on complete delithiation and reversible cycling propertiesare maintained when cycled back to 4.2 V. \textcopyright 1996 The Electrochemical Society, Inc.},

The ionic diffusion constant of Li1 and Y31 into microcrystalline and nanocrystalline V2O5 was measured by the galvanostatic intermittent titration technique. The Y31 ion diffusion constant into a 500 nm crystalline V2O5 was found to be approximately two orders of magnitude lower than for the Li1 ion. In order to enable practical intercalation of Y31, a nanocrystalline V2O5 was fabricated through a combustion flame synthesis technique. For the first time, reversible electrochemical intercalation of Y31 into a host structure was shown to be feasible. An asymmetric hybrid cell configuration was utilized in order to provide a reversible counter electrode during intercalation. Preliminary data indicates Y31 can be reversibly intercalated into V2O5 with apparent gravimetric capacities exceeding that of Ca21, Mg21, or Li1 over the limited voltage range of 2.5 to 4.2 V (Li/Li1). The concept of polyvalent intercalation is discussed relative to intercalation, pseudocapacitance, apparent specific capacity, and practical energy storage systems.},

  abstract = {The reduction of nitrogen (N2) to ammonia (NH3) is a requisite transformation for life. Although it is widely appreciated that the iron-rich cofactors of nitrogenase enzymes facilitate this transformation, how they do so remains poorly understood. A central element of debate has been the exact site or sites of N2 coordination and reduction. In synthetic inorganic chemistry, an early emphasis was placed on molybdenum because it was thought to be an essential element of nitrogenases and because it had been established that well-defined molybdenum model complexes could mediate the stoichiometric conversion of N2 to NH3 (ref. 9). This chemical transformation can be performed in a catalytic fashion by two well-defined molecular systems that feature molybdenum centres. However, it is now thought that iron is the only transition metal essential to all nitrogenases, and recent biochemical and spectroscopic data have implicated iron instead of molybdenum as the site of N2 binding in the FeMo-cofactor. Here we describe a tris(phosphine)borane-supported iron complex that catalyses the reduction of N2 to NH3 under mild conditions, and in which more than 40 per cent of the proton and reducing equivalents are delivered to N2. Our results indicate that a single iron site may be capable of stabilizing the various NxHy intermediates generated during catalytic NH3 formation. Geometric tunability at iron imparted by a flexible iron-boron interaction in our model system seems to be important for efficient catalysis. We propose that the interstitial carbon atom recently assigned in the nitrogenase cofactor may have a similar role, perhaps by enabling a single iron site to mediate the enzymatic catalysis through a flexible iron-carbon interaction.},

Despite investigations for more than one hundred years 1\textendash 5 , it is only recently that the molecular intricacies of these processes have been revealed by scanning probe microscopy 6\textendash 8 . To organize and understand this large amount of new information, new rules for crystal growth need to be developed and tested. However, because of the complexity and variety of different crystal systems, attempts to understand crystal growth in detail have so far relied on developing models that are usually applicable to only one system 9\textendash 11 . Such models cannot be used to achieve the wide scope of understanding that is required to create a unified model across crystal types and crystal structures. Here we describe a general approach to understanding and, in theory, predicting the growth of a wide range of crystal types, including the incorporation of defect structures, by simultaneous molecular-scale simulation of crystal habit and surface topology using a unified kinetic three-dimensional partition model. This entails dividing the structure into `natural tiles' or Voronoi polyhedra that are metastable and, consequently, temporally persistent. As such, these units are then suitable for re-construction of the crystal via a Monte Carlo algorithm. We demonstrate our approach by predicting the crystal growth of a diverse set of crystal types, including zeolites, metal\textendash organic frameworks, calcite, urea and l-cystine.},

Here, in particular, bulk viscosities and ionic conductivities of butyl-methyl-imidazole based RTILs are presented over a wide range of temperatures. The dependence of the properties of the liquids on simulation parameters, e.g., system-size effects or the choice of the interaction potential, is analyzed in detail.},

The most striking differences are that these species are composed only of ions and in general negatively charged. In many IL-based electrolytes, the dominant species are triplets, and the charge, stability, and size of the triplets have a large impact on the total ion conductivity, the lithium ion mobility, and also the lithium ion delivery at the electrode. As an inherent advantage, the triplets can be altered by selecting lithium salts and ionic liquids with different anions. Thus, within certain limits, the lithium ion carrying species can even be tailored toward distinct important properties for battery application. Here, we show by DFT calculations that the resulting charge carrying species from combinations of ionic liquids and lithium salts and also some resulting electrolyte properties can be predicted.},

The gases considered include benzene, carbon dioxide, nitrous oxide, ethylene, ethane, oxygen, and carbon monoxide. Carbon dioxide and oxygen solubilities are also reported in methyl-tributylammonium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl) imide, butyl-methyl pyrrolidinium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl) imide, and tri-isobutyl-methyl phosphonium p-toluenesulfonate. We report the associated Henry's constants and enthalpies and entropies of absorption. In general, benzene, followed by carbon dioxide and nitrous oxide, have the highest solubilities and strongest interactions with the ionic liquids, followed by ethylene and ethane. Oxygen had very low solubilities and weak interactions. Carbon monoxide had a solubility below the detection limit of our apparatus. Ionic liquids with the bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl) imide anion had the largest affinity for CO(2), regardless of whether the cation was imidazolium, pyrrolidinium, or tetraalkylammonium. These results suggest that the nature of the anion has the most significant influence on the gas solubilities.},

All X-ray investigated ternary and quaternary lithium-containing inorganic compounds (822 compounds LiaXbOz and 1349 compounds LiaX1bX2cOz, where X, X1 and X2 are any chemical elements) are analyzed and the dimensionality of channel systems, providing transport of lithium ions, is determined. For all compounds the migration maps (conduction patterns) characterizing the conduction channel systems of dimensions 1, 2 or 3, are constructed. We have found the coordinates of lithium atoms as centres of the cages obtained, and the coordinates fit the experimental data accurate to 0.6 \textbackslash AAV . Totally, 277 compounds with infinite systems of conduction channels are invented. Out of them, 251 compounds (126 structural types) were mentioned in the literature as solid electrolytes, the other 26 (24 structural types) can be considered as potential ionic conductors with 1D (for 16 types), 2D (for 2 types) or 3D (for 6 types) conductivity.},

From the analysis of (7)Li NMR quadrupole interactions (C(Q) and {$\eta$} parameters), spin-spin T(2)(-1) and spin-lattice T(1)(-1) relaxation rates, structural sites occupancy and mobility of lithium have been deduced. Below 250 K, Li ions are preferentially located at M(1) sites in rhombohedral phases, but occupy intermediate M(12) sites between M(1) and M(2) sites in triclinic ones. In high-temperature rhombohedral phases, a superionic state is achieved when residence times at M(1) and M(12) sites become similar and correlation effects on Li motion decrease. This state can be obtained by large order-disorder transformations in rhombohedral phases or by sharp first order transitions in triclinic ones. The presence of two relaxation mechanisms in T(1)(-1) plots of rhombohedral phases has been associated with departures of conductivity from the Arrhenius behavior. Long term mobility of lithium is discussed in terms of the cation vacancy distribution along conduction paths.},

In contrast, Li+ may be extracted from Mn4+-based solids, e.g., Li2MnO3, without oxidation of Mn4+. A mechanism involving simultaneous Li and O removal is often proposed. Here, we demonstrate directly, by in situ differential electrochemical mass spectrometry (DEMS), that O2 is evolved from such Mn4+ -containing compounds, Li[Ni(0.2)Li(0.2)Mn(0.6)]O2, on charging and using powder neutron diffraction show that O loss from the surface is accompanied by diffusion of transition metal ions from surface to bulk where they occupy vacancies created by Li removal. The composition of the compound moves toward MO(2). Understanding such unconventional Li extraction is important because Li-Mn-Ni-O compounds, irrespective of whether they contain Co, can, after O loss, store 200 mAhg(-1) of charge compared with 140 mAhg(-1) for LiCoO(2).},

Three structures were identified, Li0.25TiO2(B), Li0.5TiO2(B), and LixTiO2(B), where x corresponds to the maximum Li content, 0.8 (bulk) and 0.9 (nanowires). Together the techniques demonstrate that at low lithium concentration (up to 0.25) the square planar lithium site at the center of the b axis channel (C site) is preferentially occupied. At higher concentration, (Li0.5TiO2(B)) the C site becomes unfavorable and the 5-coordinate A1 site is occupied, whereas at the highest Li content, both A1 and a further 5-coordinate site, A2, are occupied equally.},

Unlike intercalation compounds, the sulfur cathode undergoes a series of complex electrochemical reactions that give rise to substantial structural and morphological changes. Here, we report ab initio molecular dynamics simulations of the lithiation and delithiation reactions that are important in Li\textendash S batteries. The lithiation is studied on two low-energy surfaces, (100) and (001), of sulfur (S8), whereas delithiation is studied on the (111) surface of lithium sulfide (Li2S). The effect of electrolyte is included by constructing interfacial systems between these surfaces and dimethoxyethane, a widely used liquid electrolyte. During both lithiation and delithiation, a layer-by-layer reaction pattern is revealed. The evolution of atomistic structure and reaction voltage during lithiation and delithiation is studied, and the microscopic reaction mechanisms are analyzed. Dissolution of lithium polysulfides into the electrolyte is also observed in our simulations, which is attributed to the strong interaction between lithium polysulfides and electrolyte molecules in the form of lithium bonds. Studies of the delithiation process in Li2S confirm that the experimentally observed initial charge barrier is of kinetic origin.},

In all cases, the calculated lithium deintercalation voltage correlates to the Mulliken X electronegativity, displaying a linear dependence for each structural type/redox couple. Experimental lithium deinsertion voltages already available in the literature support these results. Computational results on Li2MSiO4 are used to evaluate the electrochemical performance of these materials. Li2FeSiO4 will develop a reversible specific capacity limited to the extraction of one lithium ion. Li2MnSiO4 is predicted to have a poor electronic conductivity. The calculated lithium extraction voltages of Co and Ni silicates are too high for current electrolytes. The optimized structure of the fully delithiated MSiO4 suggests that this host is unstable, pointing out to a possible structural transformation during the charge/discharge of the lithium cells.},

Ground-state properties of solids have been extensively investigated for several decades within the standard density functional theory. Excited-state properties, on the other hand, were relatively unexplored in ab initio calculations until a decade ago. The most suitable approach up to now for studying excited-state properties of extended systems is the Green function method. To calculate the Green function one requires the self-energy operator which is non-local and energy dependent. In this article we describe the \{GW\} approximation which has turned out to be a fruitful approximation to the self-energy. The Green function theory, numerical methods for carrying out the self-energy calculations, simplified schemes, and applications to various systems are described. Self-consistency issue and new developments beyond the \{GW\} approximation are also discussed as well as the success and shortcomings of the \{GW\} approximation.},

TNO-TG hybrid nanomaterial showed excellent electrochemical performance when studied as anode for Lithium-ion battery, with an exceptionally high rate capability (capacity retention of 80\% at 16C rate) along with high discharge capacity ({$\sim$}230mAhg-1 after 50 cycles at 0.1C). A full cell Li-ion battery has been fabricated with TNO-TG as anode and LiNi1/3Mn1/3Co1/3O2:LiNi0.5Mn0.5O2 (wt\% of 75:25) as cathode, which delivered an average cell voltage of {$\sim$}2.5V with an initial anode-specific discharge capacity of 211mAhg-1, when cycled in the voltage range of 1.5\textendash 3.5V at 0.1C. The obtained results are very promising and we believe the current findings will lead to new directions in the on-going search for safe and high performance anodes for rechargeable lithium-ion batteries.},

The algorithm identifies and measures the sizes of bonded atomic clusters in a structure's unit cell, and determines their scaling with cell size. The search yielded 826 stable layered materials, which are considered as candidates for the formation of two-dimensional monolayers via exfoliation. Density-functional theory calculates the exfoliation energy of each material and 681 monolayers are found to exhibit exfoliation energies below those of certain already-extant two-dimensional materials, indicating the possibility of exfoliating them from bulk phases. The crystal structures of these two-dimensional materials provide templates for future theoretical searches of stable two-dimensional materials. The optimized structures and other data for all 826 monolayers are provided at https://materialsweb.org.},

Decomposition reactions of siloxanes in their oxidized states were investigated and compared against their carbon analogues. These studies suggest that the SiO group provides added stability for siloxanes over their carbon analogues. Computational studies have also been performed for various disiloxanes and siloxanes with spacer groups to understand their thermochemical stability and oxidation potentials.},

The presence of some additives in solutions (e.g., Li2COR, CO2, tributylamine) and the effect of the particle size of the carbon on the electrode's behavior were investigated. The correlation between the surface chemistry, the morphology, and the performance of Li and graphite electrodes was explored using surface sensitive Fourier transform infrared and x-ray and photoelectron spectroscopies, impedance spectroscopy, x-ray diffraction and scanning electron microscopy in conjunction with standard electrochemical techniques. Synthetic graphite anodes could be cycled (Li intercalation-deintercalation) hundreds of times at a capacity close to the optimal (x \textrightarrow{} 1 in LixC6) in EC-DMC solutions due to the formation of highly stable and passivating surface films in which EC reduction products such as (CH2OCO2Li)2 are the major constituents. The cycling efficiency of Li metal anodes in these solutions, however, is lower than that obtained in ethereal solutions and seems to be too low for Li-metal liquid electrolyte, rechargeable battery application. The connection between the solution composition and the electrode's performance is discussed.},

We utilize a hierarchical form of the Laplace prior to model the sparsity of the unknown signal. We describe the relationship among a number of sparsity priors proposed in the literature, and show the advantages of the proposed model including its high degree of sparsity. Moreover, we show that some of the existing models are special cases of the proposed model. Using our model, we develop a constructive (greedy) algorithm designed for fast reconstruction useful in practical settings. Unlike most existing CS reconstruction methods, the proposed algorithm is fully automated, i.e., the unknown signal coefficients and all necessary parameters are estimated solely from the observation, and, therefore, no user-intervention is needed. Additionally, the proposed algorithm provides estimates of the uncertainty of the reconstructions. We provide experimental results with synthetic 1-D signals and images, and compare with the state-of-the-art CS reconstruction algorithms demonstrating the superior performance of the proposed approach.},

Previous work on irreversible growth is extended to include relaxation of island shapes by edge diffusion. Island morphologies range from ramified structures at low temperatures to compact, polygonal shapes at higher temperatures. Using a self-consistent calculation of the rate coefficients, quantitative agreement is obtained between the solution to coupled, mean-field rate equations and the simulation results for average quantities. The island size distribution function is described by a single universal ''scaling function.'' The average island size is the only important scale for determining island densities. It is shown that the general form of the scaling ansatz applies to wider range of coverages than anticipated previously. This scaling form is combined with the solution to the rate equations to explore explicitly the D/F dependence of the number density of islands (D is the surface diffusion coefficient and F is the deposition flux). \textcopyright{} 1994 The American Physical Society.}

  abstract = {Enabling long cyclability of high-voltage oxide cathodes is a persistent challenge for all-solid-state batteries, largely because of their poor interfacial stabilities against sulfide solid electrolytes. While protective oxide coating layers such as LiNbO3 (LNO) have been proposed, its precise working mechanisms are still not fully understood. Existing literature attributes reductions in interfacial impedance growth to the coating's ability to prevent interfacial reactions. However, its true nature is more complex, with cathode interfacial reactions and electrolyte electrochemical decomposition occurring simultaneously, making it difficult to decouple each effect. Herein, we utilized various advanced characterization tools and first-principles calculations to probe the interfacial phenomenon between solid electrolyte Li6PS5Cl (LPSCl) and high-voltage cathode LiNi0.85Co0.1Al0.05O2 (NCA). We segregated the effects of spontaneous reaction between LPSCl and NCA at the interface and quantified the intrinsic electrochemical decomposition of LPSCl during cell cycling. Both experimental and computational results demonstrated improved thermodynamic stability between NCA and LPSCl after incorporation of the LNO coating. Additionally, we revealed the in situ passivation effect of LPSCl electrochemical decomposition. When combined, both these phenomena occurring at the first charge cycle result in a stabilized interface, enabling long cyclability of all-solid-state batteries.},

  abstract = {Lithium superionic conductors are the critical enabling component for next-generation all-solid lithium-ion batteries. In particular, the {$\beta$} polymorph of Li3PS4 has attracted major interest due to its combination of excellent ionic conductivity and passivating interfacial stability with Li. In this work, we systematically investigated the effect of oxygenation in {$\beta$}-Li3PS4 to further enhance its ionic conductivity and electrochemical stability using density functional theory calculations and ab initio molecular dynamics simulations. We predict that a maximum ionic conductivity of 1.52 mS cm-1 (and minimum activation energy) can be achieved at x = 0.25 in Li3PS4-xOx which is about 7 times higher than that of {$\beta$}-Li3PS4. This increase in ionic conductivity can be attributed to the flattening of the potential energy surface due to the diversification of the Li chemical environments by the S-O mixed-anionic framework, resulting in a change from quasi-2D to 3D Li diffusion. We highlight that the spatial localization of the electrostatic potential is a qualitative descriptor to assess the migration barrier of the charge carrier in the S-O mixed framework. These microscopic analyses shed light on the role of critical oxygen concentration to tune the rate-performance of mixed-anion lithium superionic conductors.},

  abstract = {The crystallographic structure and microstructure of solid electrolytes, such as Li7La3Zr2O12 (LLZO), have a profound impact on their reactivity, conductivity, and stability toward dendrites in solid-state batteries. Controlling the material's structure and morphology requires fine control during the synthesis process, where multiple conditions (precursor particle size/distribution, calcination/sintering temperature, ramp rate, etc.) influence performance. This paper describes, for the first time, the operando characterization of the calcination process using synchrotron X-ray diffraction combined with a mesoscale model of grain growth during the calcination and densification of LLZO. The model is then used to guide synthesis conditions to enhance the densification process. The X-ray data reveal significant coarsening of the initial nanophase lanthanum zirconate precursors during conversion to LLZO. The mesoscale model shows that the activation energy for diffusion during calcination is lower than that during sintering, indicating the inherent coupling between the chemical reaction and grain growth processes. Simulations suggest that particles with small and bimodal size distribution experience better densification, as does precise grading (smaller particles near the surface and larger particles at the center) of different-sized particles. The approach described here can be adapted to understand and guide the synthesis of other materials that undergo calcination and sintering (e.g., transition metal oxide cathodes).},

  abstract = {Clean energy production has become one of the most prominent global issues of the early 21st century, prompting social, economic, and scientific debates regarding energy usage, energy sources, and sustainable energy strategies. The reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, specifically carbon dioxide (CO(2)), figures prominently in the discussions on the future of global energy policy. Billions of tons of annual CO(2) emissions are the direct result of fossil fuel combustion to generate electricity. Producing clean energy from abundant sources such as coal will require a massive infrastructure and highly efficient capture technologies to curb CO(2) emissions. Current technologies for CO(2) removal from other gases, such as those used in natural gas sweetening, are also capable of capturing CO(2) from power plant emissions. Aqueous amine processes are found in the vast majority of natural gas sweetening operations in the United States. However, conventional aqueous amine processes are highly energy intensive; their implementation for postcombustion CO(2) capture from power plant emissions would drastically cut plant output and efficiency. Membranes, another technology used in natural gas sweetening, have been proposed as an alternative mechanism for CO(2) capture from flue gas. Although membranes offer a potentially less energy-intensive approach, their development and industrial implementation lags far behind that of amine processes. Thus, to minimize the impact of postcombustion CO(2) capture on the economics of energy production, advances are needed in both of these areas. In this Account, we review our recent research devoted to absorptive processes and membranes. Specifically, we have explored the use of room-temperature ionic liquids (RTILs) in absorptive and membrane technologies for CO(2) capture. RTILs present a highly versatile and tunable platform for the development of new processes and materials aimed at the capture of CO(2) from power plant flue gas and in natural gas sweetening. The desirable properties of RTIL solvents, such as negligible vapor pressures, thermal stability, and a large liquid range, make them interesting candidates as new materials in well-known CO(2) capture processes. Here, we focus on the use of RTILs (1) as absorbents, including in combination with amines, and (2) in the design of polymer membranes. RTIL amine solvents have many potential advantages over aqueous amines, and the versatile chemistry of imidazolium-based RTILs also allows for the generation of new types of CO(2)-selective polymer membranes. RTIL and RTIL-based composites can compete with, or improve upon, current technologies. Moreover, owing to our experience in this area, we are developing new imidazolium-based polymer architectures and thermotropic and lyotropic liquid crystals as highly tailorable materials based on and capable of interacting with RTILs.},

Application of transition state theory leads To the standard Marcus formulation of electron transfer rare constants. Electron transfer in solution is coupled to solvent polarization effects, and relaxation processes can contribute to and even control electron transfer. The inverted region, in which electron transfer rate constants decrease with increasing exoergicity, is one of the most striking phenomena in electron transfer chemistry. It is predicted by both semiclassical and quantum mechanical models, with the latter appropriate if there are coupled high- or medium-frequency vibrations, The intramolecular reorganizational energy has different contributions from different vibrational modes, which, in favorable cases, can be measured on a mode-by-mode basis by resonance Raman spectroscopy. Alternatively, mode-averaging procedures are available for including multimode contributions based on absorption or emission spectra. Rate constants for intramolecular electron transfer depend on electronic coupling and orbital overlap and, therefore, on distance. Mixed-valence systems have provided an important experimental platform for investigating solvent and structural effects and the transition between localized and delocalized behavior. One of the important developments in electron transfer is the use of absorption and emission measurements to calculate electron transfer rate constants. Ultrafast electron transfer measurements have been used to uncover nonequilibrium relaxation effects, an area that presents special challenges to the understanding of the dynamics and relaxation of the coupled processes. Electron transfer in the sas phase offers substantial insights into the nature of the electron transfer process. Similarly, electron transport in conductive polymers and synthetic metals depends on the basic principles of electron transfer, with some special nuances of their own.},

It is similar to the randomized, incremental algorithms for convex hull and delaunay triangulation. We provide empirical evidence that the algorithm runs faster when the input contains nonextreme points and that it used less memory. computational geometry algorithms have traditionally assumed that input sets are well behaved. When an algorithm is implemented with floating-point arithmetic, this assumption can lead to serous errors. We briefly describe a solution to this problem when computing the convex hull in two, three, or four dimensions. The output is a set of ``thick'' facets that contain all possible exact convex hulls of the input. A variation is effective in five or more dimensions.},

In all preparative approaches a carbothermally synthesized vanadium{$\sim$}III! phosphate, VPO4 , was used as a suitable intermediate phase. The NaVPO4F is found to crystallize with a tetragonal symmetry {$\sim$}space group I4/mmm) and is structurally related to the previously reported sodium aluminum fluorophosphate phase, Na3Al2(PO4)3F2 . Low rate testing of the solid state and hydrothermally prepared NaVPO4F samples reveals a reversible specific capacity in the range 97-110 mAh/g, and this performance is coupled to exceptional insertion stability at both 23 and 60\textdegree C. The voltage profile response during extraction/insertion for the NaVPO4F system is consistent with the alkali ions occupying two energetically nonequivalent crystallographic sites within the fluorophosphate framework. The LiVPO4F phase crystallizes with a triclinic structure {$\sim$}space group P1\textasciimacron ), and is found to be isostructural with the known mineral, Tavorite, LiFePO4  OH. High-resolution electrochemical measurements reveal a structured voltage response for the lithium extraction process consistent with the lithium ions occupying two crystallographic positions. For the solid-state synthesized LiVPO4F sample, the discharge process suggests a two-phase insertion mechanism coupled to phase nucleation behavior. Elevated temperature testing indicates that the lithium extraction process may yield the novel delithiated phase, VPO4F. The reversible specific capacities for the solid-state and ion-exchanged LiVPO4F materials are found to approach 120 mAh/g and when coupled to an average discharge voltage in the range 4.10-4.20 V vs. Li, we believe this insertion system may offer some favorable characteristics for commercial application.},

  abstract = {The quest to explore and to discover novel cathode materials is key to sustaining the progress of Li-ion rechargeable batteries. It has encouraged materials' chemists to design and develop a variety of polyanionic compounds. This paper reports and summarizes recent progress in the development of alkali metal pyrophosphate based cathode materials for battery applications. It points out that the pyrophosphate-based polyanionic-framework materials offer a rich crystal chemistry, ease of synthesis and robust structure offering good alkali-ion mobility. Thus, they can form a promising class of cathode materials both for lithium- and sodium-ion secondary batteries. In the Perspectives section, it is speculated that keen study of the myriad of pyrophosphate phases, selective screening and design of key pyrophosphate compounds with open frameworks and optimizing those compounds with nanosizing and carbon coating can lead to breakthroughs in the realization of commercially viable high-voltage Li-ion and Na-ion pyrophosphate cathodes.},

We present density functional theory (DFT) calculated *OH and *O adsorption energies on a random subset of available binding sites on the surface of the HEA IrPdPtRhRu. Employing a simple machine learning algorithm, we predict remaining adsorption energies, finding good agreement between calculated and predicted values. With a full catalog of available adsorption energies, an appropriate expression for predicting catalytic activity was used to optimize the HEA composition. The HEA then becomes a design platform for the unbiased discovery of new alloys by promoting sites with exceptional catalytic activity. Setting different optimization constraints led to a new HEA composition and binary alloy IrPt, showing significant enhancements over pure Pt(111).},

NMR results on purple bacterial antenna complexes show how the packing of the protein and the pigments inside the light-harvesting oligomers induces mutual conformational stress. The protein scaffold produces deformation and electrostatic polarization of the BChl macrocycles and leads to a partial electronic charge transfer between the BChls and their coordinating histidines, which can tune the light-harvesting function. In chlorosome antennae assemblies, the NMR template structure reveals how the chromophores can direct their self-assembly into higher macrostructures which, in turn, tune the light-harvesting properties of the individual molecules by controlling their disorder, structural deformation, and electronic polarization without the need for a protein scaffold. These results pave the way for addressing the next challenge, which is to resolve the functional conformational dynamics of the lhc antennae of oxygenic species that allows them to switch between light-emitting and light-energy dissipating states.},

  abstract = {Artificial intelligence (AI) has undergone a renaissance recently, making major progress in key domains such as vision, language, control, and decision-making. This has been due, in part, to cheap data and cheap compute resources, which have fit the natural strengths of deep learning. However, many defining characteristics of human intelligence, which developed under much different pressures, remain out of reach for current approaches. In particular, generalizing beyond one's experiences--a hallmark of human intelligence from infancy--remains a formidable challenge for modern AI. The following is part position paper, part review, and part unification. We argue that combinatorial generalization must be a top priority for AI to achieve human-like abilities, and that structured representations and computations are key to realizing this objective. Just as biology uses nature and nurture cooperatively, we reject the false choice between "hand-engineering" and "end-to-end" learning, and instead advocate for an approach which benefits from their complementary strengths. We explore how using relational inductive biases within deep learning architectures can facilitate learning about entities, relations, and rules for composing them. We present a new building block for the AI toolkit with a strong relational inductive bias--the graph network--which generalizes and extends various approaches for neural networks that operate on graphs, and provides a straightforward interface for manipulating structured knowledge and producing structured behaviors. We discuss how graph networks can support relational reasoning and combinatorial generalization, laying the foundation for more sophisticated, interpretable, and flexible patterns of reasoning. As a companion to this paper, we have released an open-source software library for building graph networks, with demonstrations of how to use them in practice.},

  abstract = {Many metal oxide photocatalysts exhibit strong variations in their photocatalytic activities as a function of their crystallographic surface orientation. In this Perspective possible fundamental reasons for the surface dependent photocatalytic properties are discussed. The majority of the data imply that the differing surface activities for photo-oxidation and -reduction reactions are mainly a consequence of electron and hole diffusion towards different surfaces. This is either due to directional charge carrier diffusion as a result of bulk anisotropies or it is a consequence of differing band bending (or flat band potentials) at the interface of the photocatalyst with its environment. Although the fundamental reason for the surface electronic structure must lie in the surface structure, no correlation between surface chemical properties and photochemical properties has yet been unambiguously determined. The importance of surface charge separation and charge trapping at the surface leads to new concepts for engineering surface properties with potentially increased photocatalytic activity. Consequently, enhancement can be achieved by synthesizing photocatalyst powders that expose surfaces with `naturally' higher photoactivity; or in a proposed approach by modifying surfaces selectively with special surface phases or monolayer heterostructures that enhance charge separation at the surface. In addition, special surface phases with a narrowed band gap may enable visible light activity of otherwise only UV active bulk materials.}

While most contemporary symmetry-aware models use invariant convolutions and only act on scalars, NequIP employs E(3)-equivariant convolutions for interactions of geometric tensors, resulting in a more information-rich and faithful representation of atomic environments. The method achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on a challenging and diverse set of molecules and materials while exhibiting remarkable data efficiency. NequIP outperforms existing models with up to three orders of magnitude fewer training data, challenging the widely held belief that deep neural networks require massive training sets. The high data efficiency of the method allows for the construction of accurate potentials using high-order quantum chemical level of theory as reference and enables high-fidelity molecular dynamics simulations over long time scales.},

Here we show by cryogenic transmission electron microscopy that the nucleation and growth of magnetite-a magnetic iron oxide with numerous bio- and nanotechnological applications-proceed through rapid agglomeration of nanometric primary particles and that in contrast to the nucleation of other minerals, no intermediate amorphous bulk precursor phase is involved.

An inversion center is most often missed in space groups C2/c (TS) and Pnma (TS). The group which has the highest probability of being falsely assigned in a crystal structure determination is space group Cc (FS), both in absolute numbers and relative to its frequency among determined crystal structures. Possibly over 10\% of all crystal structures reported in Cc (FS) should actually be described in a higher true symmetry (C2/c, Fdd2 or R3c). For comparative purposes statistics of the frequency of space groups among inorganic crystal structures are given and compared with the corresponding distribution among organic compounds. Each space group appears to be occupied by at least one example. Inorganic substances are heavily concentrated in space groups of the most symmetric crystal classes of trigonal, tetragonal, hexagonal and cubic symmetry.

We show that regardless of the model, adsorption and activation of water is practically iden- tical for both metals, whereas the dissociation is energetically more favorable on Rh. The experimentally observed difference thus must be attributed to stronger interaction of dissociated water with the metal surfaces or to the presence of the oxide support.

In particular, inorganic and hybrid perovskite materials undergo structural phase transitions associated with octahedral tilts of the metal-halide octahedra. We investigate the structural instabilities present in inorganic CsMX 3 perovskites with Pb or Sn on the metal site and Br or I on the X site. Defining primary order parameters in terms of symmetry-adapted collective displacement modes and secondary order parameters in terms of symmetrized Hencky strain components, we unravel the coupling between octahedral tilt modes and macroscopic strains as well as the role of A-site displacements in perovskite phase stability. Symmetry-allowed secondary strain order parameters are enumerated for the 14 unique perovskite tilt systems. Using first-principles calculations to explore the Born-Oppenheimer energy surface in terms of symmetrized order parameters, we find coupling between octahedral tilting and A-site displacements is necessary to stabilize P nma ground states. Additionally, we show that the relative stability of an inorganic halide perovskite tilt system correlates with the volume decrease from the high-symmetry cubic phase to the low-symmetry distorted phase.},

Arguments to support this view are presented, and a semiempirical exchange-correlation functional containing local-spin-density, gradient, and exact-exchange terms is tested on 56 atomization energies, 42 ionization potentials, 8 proton affinities, and 10 total atomic energies of first- and second-row systems. This functional performs significantly better than previous functionals with gradient corrections only, and fits experimental atomization energies with an impressively small average absolute deviation of 2.4 kcal/mol.},

  abstract = {Nanostructured semiconductors emit light from electronic states known as excitons[1]. According to Hund's rules[2], the lowest energy exciton in organic materials should be a poorly emitting triplet state. Analogously, the lowest exciton level in all known inorganic semiconductors is believed to be optically inactive. These 'dark' excitons (into which the system can relax) hinder light-emitting devices based on semiconductor nanostructures. While strategies to diminish their influence have been developed[3-5], no materials have been identified in which the lowest exciton is bright. Here we show that the lowest exciton in quasi-cubic lead halide perovskites is optically active. We first use the effective-mass model and group theory to explore this possibility, which can occur when the strong spin-orbit coupling in the perovskite conduction band is combined with the Rashba effect [6-10]. We then apply our model to CsPbX3 (X=Cl,Br,I) nanocrystals[11], for which we measure size- and composition-dependent fluorescence at the single-nanocrystal level. The bright character of the lowest exciton immediately explains the anomalous photon-emission rates of these materials, which emit 20 and 1,000 times faster[12] than any other semiconductor nanocrystal at room[13-16] and cryogenic[17] temperatures, respectively. The bright exciton is further confirmed by detailed analysis of the fine structure in low-temperature fluorescence spectra. For semiconductor nanocrystals[18], which are already used in lighting[19,20], lasers[21,22], and displays[23], these optically active excitons can lead to materials with brighter emission and enhanced absorption. More generally, our results provide criteria for identifying other semiconductors exhibiting bright excitons with potentially broad implications for optoelectronic devices.},

For charge compensation, the material was also co-doped with alkali metal ions (Li \th{} , Na \th{} , K \th{} ). Powder X-ray diffraction results revealed that the material was in rhombohedral phase with space group R3m. Calculated lattice parameters were found to be slightly changed upon doping and co-doping. Scanning electron microscopy images showed that the nanoparticles have spherical morphology. The photo-luminescence and cathodoluminescence studies disclosed that the nanophosphors emitted red light under UV and electron excitation which corresponds with the characteristic emission of the Eu 3\th{} ion ( 5 D 0 / 7 F j , j {$\frac{1}{4}$} 1e5). Enhancement in the PL intensity of the phosphors was observed upon co-doping due to charge compensation. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, suggests that Eu is mostly present in (\th 3) valance state in the phosphor. The approximate Commission Internationale de l'Eclairage coordinates for PL (0.62, 0.35) and CL (0.61, 0.38) were found to be very close to the commercial red emitting phosphor. The results suggest that the phosphor with high color purity (85\%) could be the preferred choice as a red component for white light emitting diodes and field emission displays.},

Once constructed, neural network potentials can provide the energies and forces many orders of magnitude faster than electronic structure calculations, and thus enable molecular dynamics simulations of large systems.

Using simple benchmark systems, the properties of several types of symmetry functions suitable for the construction of high-dimensional neural network potential-energy surfaces are discussed in detail. The symmetry functions are general and can be applied to all types of systems such as molecules, crystalline and amorphous solids, and liquids.},

Unfortunately, the application of first principles methods with predictive power is still limited to rather small systems, and in spite of the rapid evolution of computer hardware no fundamental change of this situation can be expected. Consequently, to reach an atomic level understanding of complex systems, the development of more efficient but equally reliable atomistic potentials has received considerable attention in recent years. A promising new development has been the introduction of machine learning (ML) methods to describe the atomic interactions. Once trained to electronic structure data, ML potentials can accelerate computer simulations by several orders of magnitude, while quantum mechanical accuracy is preserved. In this article, the methodology of an important class of ML potentials employing artificial neural networks is reviewed.},

We found that for all pressures the emission from the 5D0 and 5D1 excited emitting state of Eu3+ was delayed in time after excitation pulse whilst emission from the 5D2 appear immediately after excitation. At pressure above 12 kbar the strong magnification of the luminescence lines related to the transitions from the 5D3 state which were very weak at ambient condition is observed. The emission decay of the 5D3 luminescence become slower when pressure is increased. All these effects are attributed to pressure-induced increase of the energy of the ground electronic configuration 4f6 of the Eu2+ with respect to the valence band edge which results in the charge transfer state, and 5D3 level crossing.},

Furthermore, we predict that full lithiation of anatase TiO2 is thermodynamically possible at positive voltages but that there is an enormous difference in Li diffusion coefficients in the dilute and fully lithiated forms of TiO2, providing an explanation for the limited capacity in large electrode particles. We also predict that Li diffusion in the ordered phase (Li0.5TiO2) is strictly one-dimensional. The TiO2 to Li0.5TiO2 phase transition has much in common with shape memory alloys. Crystallographically, it can support strain invariant interfaces separating TiO2 and Li0.5TiO2 within the same particle. The strain invariant interfaces are parallel to the one-dimensional diffusion direction in Li0.5TiO2, which, we argue, has important consequences for the role of particle shape on achievable capacity, charge and discharge rates, and hysteresis.},

Supervalent doping introduces vacancies into the Li sublattice, increasing the overall entropy and reducing the free energy gain from ordering, eventually stabilizing the cubic phase. We show that the critical temperature for cubic phase stability is lowered as Li vacancy concentration (dopant level) is raised and that an activated hop of Li ions from one crystallographic site to another always accompanies the transition. By identifying the relevant mechanism and critical concentrations for achieving the high conductivity phase, this work shows how targeted synthesis could be used to improve electrolytic performance.},

  abstract = {Sodium layered oxides Na(x)CoO(2) form one of the most fascinating low-dimensional and strongly correlated systems; in particular P2-Na(x)CoO(2) exhibits various single-phase domains with different Na(+)/vacancy patterns depending on the sodium concentration. Here we used sodium batteries to clearly depict the P2-Na(x)CoO(2) phase diagram for x{$\geq$}0.50. By coupling the electrochemical process with an in situ X-ray diffraction experiment, we identified the succession of single-phase or two-phase domains appearing on sodium intercalation with a rather good accuracy compared with previous studies. We reported new single-phase domains and we underlined the thermal instability of some ordered phases from an electrochemical study at various temperatures. As each phase is characterized by the position of its Fermi level versus the Na(+)/Na couple, we showed that the synthesis of each material, even in large amounts, can be carried out electrochemically. The physical properties of the as-prepared Na(1/2)CoO(2) and Na(2/3)CoO(2) ordered phases were characterized and compared. Electrochemical processes are confirmed to be an accurate route to precisely investigate in a continuous way such a complex system and provide a new way to synthesize materials with a very narrow existence range.},

Concentration dependent diffusion coefficients are calculated by applying kinetic Monte Carlo simulations to a first-principles parametrized cluster expansion of the configurational energy and migration barriers. Diffusion mechanisms in spinel transition metal oxide intercalation compounds are sensitive to the Li concentration. Below x=0 in Li1+xTi2O4, Li ions occupy tetrahedral sites and individual Li hops between neighboring tetrahedral sites pass through intermediate octahedral sites, which we find to be activated states as opposed to local minima. The migration barriers are sensitive to the overall Li concentration, decreasing as the Li concentration over the tetrahedral sites is increased. A miscibility gap exists between LiTi2O4 and Li2Ti2O4. Li-diffusion mechanisms in Li2Ti2O4 are qualitatively different from those in Li1+xTi2O4 when x0, with Li hops between neighboring octahedral sites passing through intermediate tetrahedral sites that are locally stable. The present study provides insight to the origin of the high Li mobility in spinel crystal structures compared to the layered crystal structures of common intercalation compounds used as electrodes in Li-ion batteries.},

Nevertheless, predictions that are strengthened by large amounts of quality data should have well-defined rates of success. Here, we show that density functional theory calculations highlight four chemical landscapes in alkali-zinc-chalcogenide ternary systems that appear to be densely populated by new phases. For such 3d10 systems, the total energy calculations are so accurate that a majority of the newly predicted ground-state phases are synthesized experimentally. Nine new ternary phases are presented, compared to the two that were previously known. The compounds Na2Zn2S3, Na6ZnSe4, Na2ZnSe2, Na2Zn2Se3, K6ZnS4, K2ZnS2, K2Zn3S4, K2ZnSe2, and K2Zn3Se4 are all semiconductors with Zn-S connectivity ranging from zero- to two-dimensional. Their anisotropic structures lead to potential applications in birefringence and UV absorption. Even for relatively common combinations of elements, the potential for computationally informed material discovery remains high.},

We test the structure map against standard density-functional theory calculations for 1:1 sp-d-valent compounds and show that our three-parameter model has a comparable predictive power.

  abstract = {The trivalent europium ion (Eu3+) is well known for its strong luminescence in the red spectral region, but this ion is also interesting from a theoretical point of view. Due to the even number of electrons in the 4f shell (4f6configuration), the crystal-field perturbation by the crystalline host matrix lifts partly or completely the degeneracies of the2S+1LJlevels. The Eu3+ion has the great advantage over other lanthanide ions with an even number of 4f electrons that the starting levels of the transitions in both the absorption and the luminescence spectrum are non-degenerate (J=0). Moreover, the interpretation of the spectra is facilitated by the small total angular momentum J of the end levels in the transitions. The number of lines observed for the5D0\textrightarrow 7FJtransitions in the luminescence spectrum or the5DJ{$\leftarrow$}7F0transitions in the absorption spectrum allows determining the site symmetry of the Eu3+ion. This review describes the spectroscopic properties of the trivalent europium ion, with emphasis on the energy level structure, the intensities of the f-f transitions (including the Judd-Ofelt theory), the decay times of the excited states and the use of the Eu3+ion as a spectroscopic probe for site symmetry determination. It is illustrated how the maximum amount of information can be extracted from optical absorption and luminescence spectra of europium(III) compounds, and how pitfalls in the interpretation of these spectra can be avoided.},

It is intuitive that disorder in glass will also result in a distribution of the activation energies (DAE) for ion conduction, which should increase the conductivity with increasing temperature, yet this has not been identified in the literature. In this Letter, a series of high precision ionic conductivity measurements are reported for 0:5Na2S \th{} 0:5{$\frac{1}{2}$}xGeS2 \th{} \dh 1 x\TH PS5=2 glasses with compositions ranging from 0 x 1.

The BiFeO3 film shows high optical transparency, while Bi2FeMnO6 shows high absorption loss in the infrared. Densityfunctional theory modeling of BiFeO3, BiMnO3 and Bi2FeMnO6 was carried out by applying the generalized gradient approximation GGA and GGA+U methods. The formation enthalpy of ordered Bi2FeMnO6 is positive for several crystal symmetries and for ferromagnetic FM or antiferromagnetic AFM spin structures at 0 K temperature, indicating B-site ordering is not favored. The electronic structure calculations are consistent with the electronic and optical properties of these films.},

Room temperature ferromagnetism was observed in the Sr(Ti0.86Co0.14)O3 and Sr(Ti0.77Co0.23)O3 films. The formation of magnetic secondary phases such as Co-metal clusters in Sr(Ti0.77Co0.23)O3 is excluded based on x-ray diffraction, cross-sectional TEM, x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and x-ray-absorption near edge spectroscopy. A large magnetic anisotropy is observed in Sr(Ti0.77Co0.23)O3 films. The net anisotropy is strongly influenced by growth conditions and the substrate and is attributed to magnetoelastic effects. The magnetoelastic anisotropy is related to the valence and spin states of the Co ions, which contribute to the ferromagnetic properties. Magneto-optical characterization yields a figure of merit (Faraday rotation/optical absorption) of 0.57 deg dB-1 in the Sr(Ti0.77Co0.23)O3 film at 1550 nm wavelength, making it potentially useful in integrated magneto-optical applications.},

  abstract = {With about two-thirds of all used energy being lost as waste heat, there is a compelling need for high-performance thermoelectric materials that can directly and reversibly convert heat to electrical energy.However, the practical realization of thermoelectricmaterials is limited by their hitherto low figure of merit,ZT, which governs the Carnot efficiency according to the second law of thermodynamics. The recent successful strategy of nanostructuring to reduce thermal conductivity has achieved record-highZT values in the range 1.5\textendash 1.8 at 750\textendash 900 kelvin1\textendash 3, but still falls short of the generally desired threshold value of 2. Nanostructures in bulk thermoelectrics allow effective phonon scattering of a significant portion of the phonon spectrum, but phonons with long mean free paths remain largely unaffected. Here we show that heat-carrying phonons with long mean free paths can be scattered by controlling and fine-tuning the mesoscale architecture of nanostructured thermoelectric materials. Thus, by consideringsourcesof scattering on all relevant length scales in a hierarchical fashion\textemdash from atomic-scale lattice disorder and nanoscale endotaxial precipitates to mesoscale grain boundaries\textemdash{} we achieve the maximum reduction in lattice thermal conductivity and a large enhancement in the thermoelectric performance of PbTe. By taking such a panoscopic approach to the scattering of heatcarrying phonons across integrated length scales, we go beyond nanostructuring and demonstrate a ZT value of 2.2 at 915 kelvin in p-type PbTe endotaxially nanostructured with SrTe at a concentration of 4 mole per cent and mesostructured with powder processing and spark plasma sintering. This increase in ZT beyond the threshold of 2 highlights the role of, and need for, multiscale hierarchical architecture in controlling phonon scattering in bulk thermoelectrics, and offers a realistic prospect of the recovery of a significant portion of waste heat.},

A number of criteria are proposed for selecting significant voids and migration channels for alkali cations Li+-Cs+ based on the average characteristics of the Voronoi-Dirichlet polyhedra for alkali metals in oxygen-containing compounds. A general algorithm to analyze the voids in crystal structures has been developed and implemented in the computer package TOPOS. This approach was used to predict the positions of Li+ and Na+ cations and to analyze their possible migration paths in the solid superionic materials Li3M2P3O12 (M=Sc, Fe; LIPHOS) and Na1+xZr2SixP3-xO12 (NASICON), whose framework structures consist of connected M octahedra and T tetrahedra. Using this approach we determine the most probable places for charge carriers (coordinates of alkali cations) and the dimensionality of their conducting sublattice with high accuracy. The theoretically calculated coordinates of the alkali cations in MT frameworks are found to correlate to within 0.33 A with experimental data for various phases of NASICON and LIPHOS. The proposed method of computer analysis is universal and suitable for investigating fast-ion conductors with other conducting components.},

Mixed valence LiVPO4F1-yOy materials were obtained for the first time over a large composition range (here, 0.35 {$\leq$} y {$\leq$} 0.75), through a single step solid state synthesis. Interestingly, the competition between the ionic character of the V3+-F bond and the strong covalency of the V4+=O vanadyl bond originates a complex crystal chemistry at the local scale, which allows to stabilize a solid solution between LiVPO4F and LiVPO4O despite a significant deviation from the Vegard's law for the cell parameters. A combined study using IR, Raman and X-ray absorption spectroscopies highlights the role of vanadyl environments on the electronic structure of vanadium's orbitals and a fortiori the electrochemical behavior. Our results underline that the electrochemical performance of LiVPO4F1-yOy-type materials can be controlled by tuning the concentration of vanadyl-type defects, i.e. by playing on the competition between the ionic V3+-F and the covalent V4+=O bond.},

To demonstrate and verify the method, we apply it to the hybrid perovskite MAPbI\$\_3\$, a promising new solar cell material. The evaluation is done by first creating finite temperature ensembles for small supercells using RPA molecular dynamics, and then evaluating the variance between the RPA and various approximate density functionals for these ensembles. We find that, contrary to recent suggestions, van der Waals functionals do not improve the description of the material, whereas hybrid functionals and the SCAN (strongly constrained appropriately normed) density functional yield very good agreement with the RPA. Finally, our study shows that in the room temperature tetragonal phase of MAPbI\$\_3\$, the molecules are preferentially parallel to the shorter lattice vectors but reorientation on ps timescales is still possible.},

The liquid density, ion self-diffusion coefficients, and conductivity predicted by MD simulations were found to be in good agreement with experimental data, where available.

Significant lithium aggregation by sharing up to three TFSI- anions bridging two lithiums was observed, particularly at lower temperatures where the lithium aggregates were found to be stable for tens of nanoseconds. Polarization of TFSI- anions is largely responsible for the formation of such lithium aggregates. Li+ transport was found to occur primarily by exchange of TFSI- anions in the first coordination shell with a smaller (similar to 30\$\textbackslash backslash\$\%) contribution also due to Li+ cations diffusing together with their first coordination shell.

The probability of ions to participate ion aggregates decreased exponentially with an increase in the size of the aggregate. Ion and solvent self-diffusion coefficients and conductivity predicted by MD simulations were in good agreement with experiments. Approximately half of the charge was transported by charged ion aggregates with the other half carried by free (uncomplexed by counterion) ions. Investigation of the Li+ transport mechanism revealed that contribution from the Li+ diffusion together with its coordination shell to the total Li+ transport is similar to the contribution arising from Li+ exchanging solvent molecules in its first coordination shell with solvents from the outer shells.},

Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of amorphous Li(2)EDC and LiMC were performed at temperatures from 393 to 600 K. Simulations reveal that Li(+) is coordinated by approximately 4.6 oxygen atoms from -COO(-) groups coming from different alkyl carbonate molecules. Charge transport in Li(2)EDC was found to be almost entirely due to Li(+). The temperature dependence of the ionic conductivity of the SEI model compounds Li(2)EDC and LiMC was found to be significantly stronger than that of liquid electrolytes (e.g., ethylene carbonate + LiTFSI), yielding extrapolated conductivities of the Li(2)EDC on order of 10(-10) S/cm at -30 degrees C.},

A combination of enthalpy of vaporization and a fraction of the cation-anion binding energy was suggested as a measure of the effective cohesive energy for ionic liquids. A deviation of some ILs from the reported master curve is explained based upon ion packing and proposed diffusion pathways.

The density, ion self-diffusion coefficients, conductivity, and viscosity of mppy(+)TFSI(-) predicted from MD simulations are in good agreement with experimental measurements. The time-dependent shear modulus of the ionic liquids was calculated and compared with that for nonionic liquids. On average each mppy(+) cation was found to be coordinated by four TFSI- anions. The angular distributions of NTFSI\textendash{} Nmppy+- NTFSI- and Nmppy+- NTFSI\textendash{} Nmppy+ exhibit a maximum at 80-90 degrees and a second maximum at 180 degrees. Correlation of ion motion was found to lower ionic conductivity by approximately one-third from the expected value based upon ion self-diffusion coefficients. Rotational motion of the cation and anion are anisotropic with the degree of anisotropy increasing with decreasing temperature. Electrostatic interactions are responsible for slowing down the dynamics of the ionic liquid by more than an order of magnitude and a dramatic decrease of the time-dependent shear modulus.},

Are TIs that esoteric, or does this reflect a fundamental problem with the current piecemeal approach to finding them? Two fundamental shortcomings of the current approach are: the focus on delocalized Bloch wavefunctions - rather than the local, chemical bonding in materials - and a classification scheme based on a collection of seemingly unrelated topological indices. To remedy these issues, we propose a new and complete electronic band theory that assembles the last missing piece - the link between topology and local chemical bonding - with the conventional band theory of electrons. Topological Quantum Chemistry is a description of the universal global properties of all possible band structures and materials comprised of a graph theoretical description of momentum space and a dual group theoretical description in real space. This patches together local \$\textbackslash backslashmathbf\{k\}\textbackslash backslashcdot \textbackslash backslashmathbf\{p\}\$ dispersions into distinct global groups of energy bands: we classify all the possible bands for all 230 crystal symmetry groups involving \$s, p\$ or \$d\$ orbitals on any of the Wyckoff positions of every space group. We show how our topological band theory sheds new light on known TIs, and demonstrate the power of our method to predict a plethora of new TIs.},

During discharge, a cell plates the metal of an anode of high-energy Fermi level such as lithium or sodium onto a cathode current collector with a low-energy Fermi level; the voltage of the cell may be determined by a cathode redox center having an energy between the Fermi levels of the anode and that of the cathode current collector. This strategy is demonstrated with a solid electrolyte that not only is wet by the metallic anode, but also has a dielectric constant capable of creating a large electric-double-layer capacitance at the two electrode/electrolyte interfaces.

  abstract = {Efficient phosphor performance, meaning a high photoluminescence quantum yield ({$\Phi$}), requires the Ce3+ ion to be hosted in a rigid crystal structure. This is particularly important when the phosphor is operated at slightly elevated temperatures, as is becoming conventional in high brightness, phosphor-converted white solid-state lightemitting diodes. We find the Debye temperature ({$\Theta$}D) of the undoped host crystal structure, which is readily calculated using ab initio methods within the quasi-harmonic approximation, is a useful proxy for structural rigidity. {$\Theta$}D is found here to correlate well with the experimentally measured {$\Phi$} for a number of Ce3+ phosphors. In addition to being rigid, the host lattice must possess a large enough band gap (Eg) that the Ce3+ 4f to 5d transition can occur without interference from a host energy channel. As a sorting diagram for efficient hosts with high {$\Phi$}, we propose using Eg of the host, also readily calculated with high reliability using hybrid functionals, as one of the axes and {$\Theta$}D as the other. Such a diagram is used to group the phosphor hosts that we have tested so far. It is interesting to note that a large Eg and high {$\Theta$}D are often contraindicated, suggesting a challenge in the search for new host structures. While the strategy is applied here for oxides hosts with Ce3+ as the activator ion, it is transferable to other classes of host compounds, and to Eu2+ based phosphors as well.},

Machine learning holds the promise of learning the kinetic energy functional via examples, by-passing the need to solve the Kohn-Sham equations. This should yield substantial savings in computer time, allowing either larger systems or longer time-scales to be tackled, but attempts to machine-learn this functional have been limited by the need to find its derivative. The present work overcomes this difficulty by directly learning the density-potential and energy-density maps for test systems and various molecules. Both improved accuracy and lower computational cost with this method are demonstrated by reproducing DFT energies for a range of molecular geometries generated during molecular dynamics simulations. Moreover, the methodology could be applied directly to quantum chemical calculations, allowing construction of density functionals of quantum-chemical accuracy.},

  abstract = {The Coincidence Site Lattice (CSL) model of grain boundaries is developed on a simple physical basis. We propose that, to a good approximation, the construction of a boundary can be described in terms of three basic steps:(1) a rigid body joining of two perfect crystals along the boundary plane (Step I); (2) a primary relaxation (Step II) consisting of relaxations in the boundary centered on 0-Lattice elements which act to improve lattice matching in these regions; and (3) a possible secondary relaxation (Step III) which produces the final structure composed of patches of a low [summation operator] boundary and secondary grain boundary dislocations. The energy after Step I is obtained by summing pairwise interactions across the boundary and is found to be relatively low for a number of low [summation operator] boundaries and to approach a larger constant value for all large [summation operator] boundaries. The energy decrease due to Step II varies monotonically with crystal misorientation according to a Read-Shockley function, and the energy decrease associated with Step III produces cusps in the energy versus misorientation curve at misorientations corresponding to low [summation operator] boundaries. The model appears to be consistent with our present knowledge of boundary structure and energy, and its general applicability is discussed.},

The data show intragranular (bulk) and grain boundary effects in which, for a given sample, both effects are characterized by a similar activation energy; a constriction resistance model for the latter is proposed based on air gaps existing in polycrystalline sinters of less than theoretical density. The data only crudely fit a Debye-like equivalent circuit, composed of frequency independent resistors and capacitors, but fit well an equivalent circuit that contains Jonscher elements, i.e., frequency dependent admittances, in addition to normal R and C elements. Two such Jonscher elements are needed, one for the grain boundary and one for the intragranular contribution. With this circuit, departures from ideality in, e.g., the cpmplex impedance, admittance, and electric modulus planes are accounted for.},

A detailed understanding of related decomposition mechanisms provides an important basis for the selection and design of stable electrolyte materials. In this article, we use density functional theory calculations with a Poisson-Boltzmann continuum solvent model to investigate the reactivity of several classes of aprotic solvents in nucleophilic substitution reactions with superoxide. We find that nucleophilic attack by O(2)(\textbullet -) at the O-alkyl carbon is a common mechanism of decomposition of organic carbonates, sulfonates, aliphatic carboxylic esters, lactones, phosphinates, phosphonates, phosphates, and sulfones. In contrast, nucleophilic reactions of O(2)(\textbullet -) with phenol esters of carboxylic acids and O-alkyl fluorinated aliphatic lactones proceed via attack at the carbonyl carbon. Chemical functionalities stable against nucleophilic substitution by superoxide include N-alkyl substituted amides, lactams, nitriles, and ethers. The results establish that solvent reactivity is strongly related to the basicity of the organic anion displaced in the reaction with superoxide. Theoretical calculations are complemented by cyclic voltammetry to study the electrochemical reversibility of the O(2)/O(2)(\textbullet -) couple containing tetrabutylammonium salt and GCMS measurements to monitor solvent stability in the presence of KO(2)(\textbullet ) and a Li salt. These experimental methods provide efficient means for qualitatively screening solvent stability in Li-air batteries. A clear correlation between the computational and experimental results is established. The combination of theoretical and experimental techniques provides a powerful means for identifying and designing stable solvents for rechargeable Li-air batteries.},

  abstract = {There exists a class of crystal structures which are derived from others by generalization. These are here designated derivative structures. A special case of derivative structure is the popular "superstructure." The symmetry of a derivative structure is a subgroup of the sym- metry of the basic structure. Here the term "subgroup" is used in a wider sense than common in mathematical crystallography, and includes subgroups with multiple cells. The methods of finding the derivative symmetries are discussed. There are two important kinds of derivative structures, here designated substitution structures and distortion structures. Substitution struc- tures result when a set of different atoms is substituted for a set of like atoms in the basic structure. For a given kind of substitution, it is possible to predict the cell dimensions of the crystal resulting from the substitution, as well as all the possible symmetries it could have. Examples are cited of the applications of derivative structure theory to several branches of crystallography.},

  abstract = {Following pioneering work, solution-processable organic-inorganic hybrid perovskites-such as CH3NH3PbX3 (X = Cl, Br, I)-have attracted attention as light-harvesting materials for mesoscopic solar cells. So far, the perovskite pigment has been deposited in a single step onto mesoporous metal oxide films using a mixture of PbX2 and CH3NH3X in a common solvent. However, the uncontrolled precipitation of the perovskite produces large morphological variations, resulting in a wide spread of photovoltaic performance in the resulting devices, which hampers the prospects for practical applications. Here we describe a sequential deposition method for the formation of the perovskite pigment within the porous metal oxide film. PbI2 is first introduced from solution into a nanoporous titanium dioxide film and subsequently transformed into the perovskite by exposing it to a solution of CH3NH3I. We find that the conversion occurs within the nanoporous host as soon as the two components come into contact, permitting much better control over the perovskite morphology than is possible with the previously employed route. Using this technique for the fabrication of solid-state mesoscopic solar cells greatly increases the reproducibility of their performance and allows us to achieve a power conversion efficiency of approximately 15 per cent (measured under standard AM1.5G test conditions on solar zenith angle, solar light intensity and cell temperature). This two-step method should provide new opportunities for the fabrication of solution-processed photovoltaic cells with unprecedented power conversion efficiencies and high stability equal to or even greater than those of today's best thin-film photovoltaic devices.},

This layered bronze possesses a hexagonal, P2-type structure, in which the distortion assocd. with Mn3+ is hardly noticeable. It reacts slowly, though reversibly, with atm. moisture, which causes the interlayer spacing in the structure to increase by {$\sim$}2.5 \textbackslash AA, by intercalation of water mols. into the interlayer gap occupied by Na+ ions. The anhyd. material was tested as a cathode in sodium cells. Although the electrochem. intercalation of Na+ occurs in two steps, the host retains its main structural features, with a slight tendency in the interlayer spacing to contract as the sodium content increases. The similarity between the discharge and charge profiles of the first cycles reveals a quasi-reversible nature of the intercalation process and that the cell can deliver a const. sp. capacity of {$\sim$}140 A-h/kg at 0.1 mA/cm2 when cycled in a voltage region of 3.8-2.0 V. However, the continuous strains and distortions resulting from the insertion and extn. of Na+ ions cause the host structure to gradually collapse and yield an amorphous material after the first eight cycles. This leads to a progressive redn. of the cell capacity, irresp. of the specific voltage region used. [on SciFinder(R)]},

CO2 absorption isotherms at 10, 25, and 50 degrees C are reported for six different ionic liquids formed by pairing three different anions with two cations that differ only in the nature of the "acidic" site at the 2-position on the imidazolium ring. Molecular dynamics simulations of these two cations paired with hexafluorophosphate in the pure state and mixed with CO2 are also described. Both the experimental and the simulation results indicate that the anion has the greatest impact on the solubility of CO2. Experimentally, it is found that the bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide anion has the greatest affinity for CO2, while there is little difference in CO2 solubility between ionic liquids having the tetrafluoroborate or hexafluorophosphate anion. The simulations show strong organization of CO2 about hexafluorophosphate anions, but only small differences in CO2 structure about the different cations. This is consistent with the experimental finding that, for a given anion, there are only small differences in CO2 solubility for the two cations. Computed and measured densities, partial molar volumes, and thermal expansion coefficients are also reported.},

In this study, we use density functional theory and ab initio molecular dynamics simulations to investigate the formation of the cathode-electrolyte interface at two limiting states of charge: S8 and Li2S. {$\beta$}-Li3PS4 and two lithium halide-doped sulfides (Li6PS5Cl and Li7P2S8I) were selected because of their Li-ion superionic conductivity and compatibility with sulfur electrodes. The work of adhesion and interfacial energy of the interfaces were calculated as descriptors of the interfacial properties, and then the mechanisms of the interfacial reactions taking place were characterized. Finally, a charge transfer analysis is presented, suggesting that, overall, the S8 electrode will oxidize the electrolyte, whereas the fully discharged Li2S cathode will reduce it at different extents depending on the reactivity of the exposed facet.},

Conventional ESP fitting procedures developed for molecular systems, in general, will not work for crystalline systems because the electrostatic potential in periodic systems is ill-defined up to a constant offset at each spatial position. In this work the problem is circumvented by introducing a new error functional which acts on the relative differences of the potential and not on its absolute values, as it is currently done with molecular ESP charge derivation methods. We formally demonstrate that the new functional reduces to the conventional error functional used in molecular ESP approaches when the simulation box of the periodic calculation becomes infinitely large. Several tests are presented to validate the new technique. For the periodic calculation of isolated molecules, the REPEAT charges are found to be in good agreement with those determined with established molecular ESP charge derivation methods. For siliceous sodalite, it is demonstrated that conventional molecular ESP approaches generate `unphysical' charges, whereas the REPEAT method produces charges that are both chemically intuitive and consistent between different periodic electronic structure packages. The new approach is employed to generate partial atomic charges of various microporous materials and compared to both experimentally derived and molecular fragment ESP charges. This method can be used to generate partial atomic charges to be used in simulations of microporous and nanoporous materials, such as zeolites and metal organic framework materials.},

We present a critical and rigorous analysis of the increasing volume of multivalent battery research, focusing on a wide range of intercalation cathode materials and the mechanisms of multivalent ion insertion and migration within those frameworks. The present analysis covers a wide variety of material chemistries, including chalcogenides, oxides, and polyanions, highlighting merits and challenges of each class of materials as multivalent cathodes. The review underscores the overlap of experiments and theory, ranging from charting the design metrics useful for developing the next generation of MV-cathodes to targeted in-depth studies rationalizing complex experimental results. On the basis of our critical review of the literature, we provide suggestions for future multivalent cathode studies, including a strong emphasis on the unambiguous characterization of the intercalation mechanisms.},

Ab initio calculations were performed to obtain several terms in the force field not yet defined in the literature. These include torsion energy profiles and distributions of atomic charges that blend smoothly with the OPLS-AA specification for alkyl chains. Validation was carried out by comparing simulated and experimental data on fourteen different salts, comprising three types of anion and five lengths of alkyl chain, in both the crystalline and liquid phases. The present model can be regarded as a step toward a general force field for ionic liquids of the imidazolium cation family that was built in a systematic way, is easily integrated with OPLS-AA/AMBER, and is transferable between different combinations of cation-anion.},

One of the torsions in bistriflylimide, cot-responding to the dihedral angle S-N-S-C, has a complex energy profile which is precisely reproduced by the present parameter set. A new set of partial electrostatic charges is also proposed for the pyrrolidinium and tri- and tetra-alkylammonium cations.

Alloys containing 16 and 20 components in equal proportions are multiphase, crystalline and brittle both as-cast and after melt spinning. A five component Fe20Cr20Mn20Ni20Co20 alloy forms a single fcc solid solution which solidifies dendritically. A wide range of other six to nine component late transition metal rich multicomponent alloys exhibit the same majority fcc primary dendritic phase, which can dissolve substantial amounts of other transition metals such as Nb, Ti and V. More electronegative elements such as Cu and Ge are less stable in the fcc dendrites and are rejected into the interdendritic regions. The total number of phases is always well below the maximum equilibrium number allowed by the Gibbs phase rule, and even further below the maximum number allowed under non-equilibrium solidification conditions. Glassy structures are not formed by casting or melt spinning of late transition metal rich multicomponent alloys, indicating that the confusion principle does not apply, and other factors are more important in promoting glass formation.},

The compounds exhibit strong light absorption in the visible region, accompanied with strong photoluminescence at room temperature, rendering them as promising light absorbers for photovoltaic applications. Moreover, we find that thin films of the semi-2D perovskites display an ultra-high surface coverage as a result of the unusual film self-assembly that orients the [PbnI3n+1]- layers perpendicular to the substrates. We have successfully implemented this 2D perovskite family in solid-state solar cells, and obtained an initial power conversion efficiency of 4.02\%, featuring an open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 929 mV and a short-circuit current density (Jsc) of 9.42 mA/cm2 from the n = 3 compound.

  abstract = {X-ray absorption spectroscopy is a premier, element-specific technique for materials characterization. Specifically, the x-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) encodes important information about the local chemical environment of an absorbing atom, including coordination number, symmetry and oxidation state. Interpreting XANES spectra is a key step towards understanding the structural and electronic properties of materials, and as such, extracting structural and electronic descriptors from XANES spectra is akin to solving a challenging inverse problem. Existing methods rely on empirical fingerprints, which are often qualitative or semi-quantitative and not transferable. In this study, we present a machine learning-based approach, which is capable of classifying the local coordination environments of the absorbing atom from simulated K-edge XANES spectra. The machine learning classifiers can learn important spectral features in a broad energy range without human bias, and once trained, can make predictions on the fly. The robustness and fidelity of the machine learning method are demonstrated by an average 86\% accuracy across the wide chemical space of oxides in eight 3d transition metal families. We found that spectral features beyond the pre-edge region play an important role in the local structure classification problem, especially for the late 3d transition metal elements.},

First-principles pseudopotential calculations within the local density approximation and thermodynamic models extracted from these calculations both show that two tetrahedral sites for the Li ions need to be considered in the T\#2 structure for qualitative agreement with experiment to be obtained. Only when both tetrahedral sites in T\#2 are considered is the experimentally observed two-phase O2/T\#2 region predicted. This indicates that this structural phase transformation is induced by enhanced configurational entropy in the T\#2 phase and not by a metal-insulator transition as was previously proposed. We also predict that two ordered compounds are stable at room temperature: Li1/4CoO2 in the O2 structure and Li1/3CoO2 in the O6 structure. We show that the formation of the O6 phase is not related to Li staging.},

Powder X-ray diffraction analysis revealed that the phase is pure in the absence of long-range ordering of Co and Mn ions in the slab or Na(+) and vacancy in the interslab space. The oxidation states of the transition metal ions were studied by magnetic susceptibility measurements, electron paramagnetic resonance (ESR) and (23)Na magic angle spinning nuclear magnetic resonance (MAS NMR) spectroscopy. The charge compensation is achieved by the stabilization of low-spin Co(3+) and Mn(4+) ions. The capability of Na(2/3)Co(2/3)Mn(1/3)O(2) to intercalate and deintercalate Na(+) reversibly was tested in electrochemical sodium cells.

The aerodynamic influence of a TT helmet large visor is also quantified as a function of the helmet inclination. Experiments conducted in a wind-tunnel on nine professional cyclists provided drag force and frontal area measurements to determine the drag force coefficient. Data statistical analysis clearly shows that the hands positioning on shifters and the elbows joined together are significantly reducing the cyclist drag force. Concerning the saddle position, the drag force is shown to be significantly increased (about 3\%) when the saddle is raised. The usual helmet inclination appears to be the inclination value minimizing the drag force. Moreover, the addition of a large visor on the helmet is shown to provide a drag coefficient reduction as a function of the helmet inclination. Present results indicate that variations in the TT cyclist posture, the saddle position and the helmet visor can produce a significant gain in time (up to 2.2\%) during stages.},

The atomic displacements responsible for the formation of DX centers in Si- and S-doped GaAs are determined. Defect formation is found to be accompanied by a large bond-rupturing lattice distortion. The results of our pseudopotential calculations indicate that DX is a highly localized and negatively charged defect center. The atomic structure for DX is shown to provide a satisfactory explanation for the large Stokes shift between its optical and thermal ionization energies. An important conclusion of our study is that DX centers are an unavoidable feature of substitutional dopants and that the formation of these defects may be suppressed via the introduction of interstitial donors which are unlikely to undergo similar structural transformations. This implies that the normal doping procedure which relies on group-IV and -VI substitutional impurities needs to be modified. Possible choices for interstitial dopants from group-III and -V elements are examined.},

Halide ion migration is one of the main contributors to instability and hysteresis in LHP solar cells. Here, we employ a series of Gedankenexperiments to quantitatively establish the correlated effects of the A site cation motion, H bonding strength, and octahedral rotation on halide ion migration in APbBr3 (A = Cs or methylammonium/MA) LHPs. We find that in cubic CsPbBr3, the increase of PbBr6 octahedra rotation/tilting during ion migration lowers the halide ion migration barrier by at least 100 meV compared to the orthorhombic phase. In MAPbBr3, we show that halide ion migration is also assisted by MA cation rotation to re-establish H bonding, resulting in lower halide migration barriers. These results suggest that ``locking'' the organic cation via chemical and processing means can help mitigate halide migration-induced instability and reduced hysteresis in LHP solar cells.},

The data reveal complex structural transformation patterns which result from significantly delayed structural transformation, even at low to moderate current rates (C/10 similar to 1 C). The extent of the deviation is affected by charge/discharge conditions as well as history, and strong deviation appears detrimental to electrode cycle life. Furthermore, the two-phase characteristic of the Li+ insertion/extraction reactions is found to persist even within one metastable crystal structure. The result suggests the presence of domain structures that are probably caused by the strong electron/ion site coulombic interaction as previously suggested. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

Silicon is an attractive anode material for lithium batteries because it has a low discharge potential and the highest known theoretical charge capacity (4,200 mAh g(-1); ref. 2). Although this is more than ten times higher than existing graphite anodes and much larger than various nitride and oxide materials, silicon anodes have limited applications because silicon's volume changes by 400\% upon insertion and extraction of lithium which results in pulverization and capacity fading. Here, we show that silicon nanowire battery electrodes circumvent these issues as they can accommodate large strain without pulverization, provide good electronic contact and conduction, and display short lithium insertion distances. We achieved the theoretical charge capacity for silicon anodes and maintained a discharge capacity close to 75\% of this maximum, with little fading during cycling.},

In this Letter, we assess these competing Li2O2 structures using a combination of the following x-ray and first-principles techniques: (i) high energy xray diffraction (XRD); (ii) comparisons of the measured non-resonant inelastic x-ray scattering (NIXS) spectra with those computed from first principles using the Bethe-Salpeter equation (BSE); and (iii) comparison of thermochemistry data with the formation enthalpies obtained from density functional theory (DFT) calculations using a hybrid functional.

Beyond chemical variations offered by the anions, the ability to control the anion order present within a single transition metal polyhedron via anionsublattice engineering offers a potentially transformative strategy in tuning material properties. The set of design rules for realizing and controlling anion order, however, are incomplete, which is due in part to the limited anion-ordered diversity in known structures. This aspect makes formulating such principles from experiment alone challenging. Here, we demonstrate how computational methods at multiple levels of theory are effective at investigating the anion site order dependencies in heteroanionic materials, HAMs, and enable the construction of crystalchemistry principles. Our approach relies on a database of anion ordered structure variants in which we manipulate the lattice degrees of freedom through the incorporation of structural distortions. Structure-property relationships and anion-order descriptors are data mined from group theoretical techniques and density functional theory calculations. Using our combined computational scheme, we uncover a hybrid improper mechanism to stabilize polar phases, propose the chemical link between local and long ranger anion order, and detail the sequence of order-disorder/displacive transitions observed experimentally in the oxyfluoride Na 3 MoO 3 F 3 . Our method is scalable and transferable to many heteroanionic chemistries and crystal families, facilitating the construction of heteroanionic materials design principles.},

  abstract = {Luminescence in Eu\$\^\{2+\}\$ activated materials corresponds to a transition from an excited state where the lowest Eu 5\$d\$ level is filled with one electron (often called the (Eu\$\^\{2+\}\$)\$\^*\$ state) to the ground state with half-filled 4\$f\$ shell with seven electrons of the same spin. We have performed theoretical calculations based on Density Functional Theory to determine the ground state band structure of Eu-doped materials as well as study the (Eu\$\^\{2+\}\$)\$\^*\$ excited state. Calculations were performed on Eu doped materials, experimentally known to be either scintillators or non-scintillators, in order to relate theoretically calculable parameters to experimentally observed properties. Applying criteria previously developed for Ce-doped systems (A.Canning, A. Chaudhry, R. Boutchko and N. Gr\$\textbackslash backslash\$o\{\}nbech-Jensen, Phys. Rev.

As discussed in our previous paper on Ce-doped materials this approach was designed as a systematic high-throughput method to aid in the discovery of new bright scintillator materials by prioritization and down-selection on the large number of potential new materials.},

We will show that by fitting to the energies, forces and stress tensors of a large density functional theory (DFT)-computed dataset on a diverse set of Mo structures, a Mo SNAP model can be developed that achieves close to DFT accuracy in the prediction of a broad range of properties, including energies, forces, stresses, elastic constants, melting point, phonon spectra, surface energies, grain boundary energies, etc. We will outline a systematic model development process, which includes a rigorous approach to structural selection based on principal component analysis, as well as a differential evolution algorithm for optimizing the hyperparameters in the model fitting so that both the model error and the property prediction error can be simultaneously lowered. We expect that this newly developed Mo SNAP model will find broad applications in large-scale, long-time scale simulations.},

Deep learning has recently garnered considerable interest in materials predictive tasks with low model errors when dealing with large materials data. However, deep learning models suffer in the small data regime that is common in materials science. Here we develop the AtomSets framework, which utilizes universal compositional and structural descriptors extracted from pre-trained graph network deep learning models with standard multi-layer perceptrons to achieve consistently high model accuracy for both small compositional data ({$<$}400) and large structural data ({$>$}130,000). The AtomSets models show lower errors than the graph network models at small data limits and other non-deep-learning models at large data limits. They also transfer better in a simulated materials discovery process where the targeted materials have property values out of the training data limits. The models require minimal domain knowledge inputs and are free from feature engineering. The presented AtomSets model framework can potentially accelerate machine learning-assisted materials design and discovery with less data restriction.},

The abundance and materials life-cycle costs of such batteries may present issues in the long term with foreseeable large-scale applications. To address the issue of sustainability of electrode materials, a radically different approach from the conventional route has been adopted to develop new organic electrode materials. The oxocarbon salt Li2C6O6 is synthesized through potentially low-cost processes free of toxic solvents and by enlisting the use of natural organic sources (CO2-harvesting entities). It contains carbonyl groups as redox centres and can electrochemically react with four Li ions per formula unit. Such battery processing comes close to both sustainable and green chemistry concepts, which are not currently present in Li-ion cell technology. The consideration of renewable resources in designing electrode materials could potentially enable the realization of green and sustainable batteries within the next decade.},

Recharging the Li\textendash O2 battery depends on oxidizing solid lithium peroxide (Li2O2), which is formed on discharge within the porous cathode. However, transporting charge between Li2O2 particles and the solid electrode surface is at best very difficult and leads to voltage polarization on charging, even at modest rates. This is a significant problem facing the non-aqueous Li\textendash O2 battery. Here we show that incorporation of a redox mediator, tetrathiafulvalene (TTF), enables recharging at rates that are impossible for the cell in the absence of the mediator. On charging, TTF is oxidized to TTF1 at the cathode surface; TTF1 in turn oxidizes the solid Li2O2, which results in the regeneration of TTF. The mediator acts as an electron\textendash hole transfer agent that permits efficient oxidation of solid Li2O2. The cell with the mediator demonstrated 100 charge/discharge cycles.},

Here, we demonstrate a controllable passivation technique for perovskite films, which enables their compositional change, and allows substantial enhancement in corresponding device performance. By releasing the organic species during annealing, PbI2 phase is presented in perovskite grain boundaries and at the relevant interfaces. The consequent passivation effects and underlying mechanisms are investigated with complementary characterizations, including scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), time-resolved photoluminescence decay (TRPL), scanning Kelvin probe microscopy (SKPM), and ultraviolet photoemission spectroscopy (UPS).

Comparisons of this theory and experimental results given in literature from varied sources and alloy types show that compositions containing relatively high {$\alpha$} values correspond to successfully produced bulk metallic glasses. Specifically, an {$\alpha$} parameter value in excess of 1 suggests a slight tendency for glass formation, while {$\alpha$} values greater than 1.5 suggest a very strong tendency. Thus, the {$\alpha$} parameter can serve as a tool for quantifying potential bulk metallic glass alloys in terms of limiting their requirement for rapid quenching. This technique is appropriate for both constituent element selection and composition optimization.},

After each resistive switching, different VO 2 monoclinic crystal orientations are observed, forming different equilibrium states. We have evaluated a statistical cycle-to-cycle variation, demonstrated a stochastic nature of the volatile resistive switching, and presented an approach to study in-plane structural anisotropy.

We present two new strategies to address data limitations common in materials science and chemistry. First, we demonstrate a physically intuitive approach to unify four separate molecular MEGNet models for the internal energy at 0 K and room temperature, enthalpy, and Gibbs free energy into a single free energy MEGNet model by incorporating the temperature, pressure, and entropy as global state inputs. Second, we show that the learned element embeddings in MEGNet models encode periodic chemical trends and can be transfer-learned from a property model trained on a larger data set (formation energies) to improve property models with smaller amounts of data (band gaps and elastic moduli).},

  abstract = {Gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) and dealloyed Au3Fe core-shell NP surfaces have been shown to have dramatically improved performance in reducing CO2 to CO (CO2RR), but the surface features responsible for these improvements are not known. The active sites cannot be identified with surface science experiments, and quantum mechanics (QM) is not practical for the 10 000 surface sites of a 10 nm NP (200 000 bulk atoms). Here, we combine machine learning, multiscale simulations, and QM to predict the performance (a-value) of all 5000-10 000 surface sites on AuNPs and dealloyed Au surfaces. We then identify the optimal active sites for CO2RR on dealloyed gold surfaces with dramatically reduced computational effort. This approach provides a powerful tool to visualize the catalytic activity of the whole surface. Comparing the a-value with descriptors from experiment, computation, or theory should provide new ways to guide the design of high-performance electrocatalysts for applications in clean energy conversion.},

The more polarizable Li3OBr shows a lower ionic conductivity than Li3OCl, contradicting the idea that a more polarizable framework is beneficial for ionic conduction. In this work, we study the influence of substituting Cl with Br on the local structure, lattice dynamics, and Li-ion conductivity of Li3OCl1-xBrx, based on first-principles calculations. We find that the incorporation of Br does soften the overall lattice stiffness of Li3OCl1-xBrx, but the accompanying local structural distortion plays a dominant role in changing the activation energy for Li-ion diffusion, which could increase the site energy as well as the Li-ion vibration frequency. We suggest that more distorted initial octahedral sites and less distorted saddle trigonal-plane sites can lead to better ionic transport. In addition, the correlation between activation energy and the pre-exponential factor of diffusivity extracted from the Arrhenius plot of Li3OCl1-xBrx is found to be nonlinear, which is due to the decreasing migration entropy with increasing activation energy.},

Here, we develop multi-fidelity graph networks as a universal approach to achieve accurate predictions of materials properties with small data sizes. As a proof of concept, we show that the inclusion of low-fidelity Perdew\textendash Burke\textendash Ernzerhof band gaps greatly enhances the resolution of latent structural features in materials graphs, leading to a 22\textendash 45\% decrease in the mean absolute errors of experimental band gap predictions. We further demonstrate that learned elemental embeddings in materials graph networks provide a natural approach to model disorder in materials, addressing a fundamental gap in the computational prediction of materials properties.},

  abstract = {White light-emitting diodes (WLEDs) have matched the emission efficiency of florescent lights and will rapidly spread as light source for homes and offices in the next 5 to 10 years. WLEDs provide a light element having a semiconductor light emitting layer (blue or near-ultraviolet (nUV) LEDs) and photoluminescence phosphors. These solid-state LED lamps, rather than organic light emitting diode (OLED) or polymer light-emitting diode (PLED), have a number of advantages over conventional incandescent bulbs and halogen lamps, such as high efficiency to convert electrical energy into light, reliability and long operating lifetime. To meet with the further requirement of high color rendering index, warm light with low color temperature, high thermal stability and higher energy efficiency for WLEDs, new phosphors that can absorb excitation energy from blue or nUV LEDs and generate visible emissions efficiently are desired. The criteria of choosing the best phosphors, for blue (450480 nm) and nUV (380400 nm) LEDs, strongly depends on the absorption and emission of the phosphors. Moreover, the balance of light between the emission from blue-nUV LEDs and the emissions from phosphors (such as yellow from Y3Al5O12:Ce3+) is important to obtain white light with proper color rendering index and color temperature. Here, we will review the status of phosphors for LEDs and prospect the future development.},

In recent years, the rapid growth of cognitive applications and the limited processing capability of conventional von Neumann architecture on these applications motivated worldwide research on neuromorphic computing systems. In this paper, we review the evolution of neuromorphic computing technique in both computing model and hardware implementation from a historical perspective. Various implementation methods and practices are also discussed. Finally, we present some emerging technologies that may potentially change the landscape of neuromorphic computing in the future, e.g., new devices and interdisciplinary computing architectures.},

Bulk lithium vacancies are found to be available and mobile under battery charging conditions, and found to pin the Fermi level at the top of the anti bonding peroxide *(2px) and *(2py) levels in the Li2O2 valence band. Under an applied bias, this can result in a reduced transmission, since the anti bonding *(2pz) level in the Li2O2 conduction band is found to couple strongly to the metal substrate and create localized interface states with poor coupling to the Li2O2 bulk states. These observations provide a possible explanation for the higher overpotential observed for charging than discharge.},

For the local spin density approximation and spin-dependent generalized gradient approximation in the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof parametrization, the effective Hund's exchange implied by the spin dependence of the exchange correlation functional is found to be larger than 1 eV. The results indicate that at least as far as applications to transition metals and their oxides are concerned, +U, +J, and +dynamical-mean-field-theory extensions of density functional theory should be based on charge-only exchange-correlation functionals.},

  abstract = {We report high efficiency luminescence with a manganese-doped aluminum nitride red-emitting phosphor under 254 nm excitation, as well as its excellent lumen maintenance in fluorescent lamp conditions, making it a candidate replacement for the widely deployed europium-doped yttria red phosphor. Solid-state reaction of aluminum nitride powders with manganese metal at 1900 \textdegree C, 10 atm N2 in a reducing environment results in nitrogen deficiency, as revealed diffuse reflectance spectra. When these powders are subsequently annealed in flowing nitrogen at 1650 \textdegree C, higher nitrogen content is recovered, resulting in white powders. Silicon was added to samples as an oxygen getter to improve emission efficiency. NEXAFS spectra and DFT calculations indicate that the Mn dopant is divalent. From DFT calculations, the UV absorption band is proposed to be due to an aluminum vacancy coupled with oxygen impurity dopants, and Mn2+ is assumed to be closely associated with this site. In contrast with some previous reports, we find that the highest quantum efficiency with 254 nm excitation (Q.E. = 0.86 {$\pm$} 0.14) is obtained in aluminum nitride with a low manganese doping level of 0.06 mol.\%. The principal Mn2+ decay of 1.25 ms is assigned to non-interacting Mn sites, while additional components in the microsecond range appear with higher Mn doping, consistent with Mn clustering and resultant exchange coupling. Slower components are present in samples with low Mn doping, as well as strong afterglow, assigned to trapping on shallow traps followed by detrapping and subsequent trapping on Mn.},

  abstract = {Vanadyl phosphates comprise a class of multielectron cathode materials capable of cycling two Li+ , about 1.66 Na+ , and some K + ions per redox center. In this review, structures, thermodynamic stabilities, and ion diffusion kinetics of various Ax VOPO 4 (A = Li, Na, K, NH4 ) polymorphs are discussed. Both the experimental data and first-principle calculations indicate kinetic limitations for alkali metal ions cycling, especially between for 0 {$\leq$} x {$\leq$} 1, and metastability of phases with x {$>$} 1. This creates challenges for multiple-ion cycling, as the slow kinetics call for nanosized particles, which being metastable and reactive with organic electrolytes are prone to side reactions. Thus, various synthesis approaches, surface coating, and transition metal ion substitution strategies are discussed here as possible ways to stabilize Ax VOPO 4 structures and improve alkali metal ion diffusion. The role of advanced characterization techniques, such as X-ray absorption spectroscopy, diffraction, pair distribution function analysis and7 Li and31 P NMR, in understanding the reaction mechanism from both structural and electronic points of view is emphasized.},

In this paper we examine the viability of Na-ion negative electrode materials based on Na alloys or hard carbons in terms of volumetric energy density. Due to the increased size of the Na atom compared to the Li atom, Na alloys would lead to negative electrode materials with roughly half the volumetric energy density of their Li analogs. Volumetric energy densities obtainable with sodiated hard carbons would also be significantly less than those obtainable with lithiated graphite. These findings highlight the need of novel ideas for Na-ion negative electrodes},

Studies of O/F orderings reveal FeOF to be particularly stable compared to other FeOxF2-x (x = 1) structures, where FeF2-FeOF mixing is not energetically favored. The band gap of FeF2 is found to decrease as oxygen is substituted into its structure. The GGA + U electronic structure evolves from that of a Mott-Hubbard insulator (x = 0) to a charge transfer semiconductor (x = 1). Lithiation studies reveal that lithiation sites offering mixed O/F environments are the most stable. An insertion voltage plateau up to Li0.5FeOF on lithiation is found, in agreement with recent Li-ion battery experiments. The energetics of further lithiation with respect to conversion scenarios are discussed.},

Conventional DFT functionals significantly underestimate redox potentials for these compounds. Zhou et al. [Phys. Rev. B 70, 235121 (2004)] addressed this issue with DFT+U and a linear-response scheme for calculating U values. We show that the Li intercalation potentials of prominent Li-ion intercalation battery materials, such as the layered LixMO2 (M=Co and Ni), LixTiS2; olivine LixMPO4 (M=Mn, Fe, Co, and Ni); and spinel-like LixMn2O4, LixTi2O4, are also well reproduced by HSE06, due to the self-interaction error correction from the partial inclusion of Hartree-Fock exchange. For formation energies, HSE06 performs well for transition metal compounds, which typically are not well reproduced by conventional DFT functionals but does not significantly improve the results of nontransition metal oxides. Hence, we find that hybrid functionals provide a good alternative to DFT+U for transition metal applications when the large extra computational effort is compensated by the benefits of (i) avoiding species-specific adjustable parameters and (ii) a more universal treatment of the self-interaction error that is not exclusive to specific atomic orbital projections on selected ions.},

However, their success is impeded by high resistance for mass and charge transfer at electrode-electrolyte interfaces. Li deficiency has been proposed as a major culprit for interfacial resistance, yet experimental evidence is elusive due to the challenges associated with noninvasively probing the Li distribution in solid electrolytes. In this Letter, three-dimensional 7Li magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is employed to examine Li distribution homogeneity in solid electrolyte Li10GeP2S12 within symmetric Li/Li10GeP2S12/ Li batteries. 7Li MRI and the derived histograms reveal Li depletion from the electrode- electrolyte interfaces and increased heterogeneity of Li distribution upon electrochemical cycling. Significant Li loss at interfaces is mitigated via facile modification with a poly(ethylene oxide)/bis(trifluoromethane)sulfonimide Li salt thin film. This study demonstrates a powerful tool for noninvasively monitoring the Li distribution at the interfaces and in the bulk of all-solidstate batteries as well as a convenient strategy for improving interfacial stability.},

Quantitative analyses reveal that with a small dose ({$<$}10 mol\%) of Na, the doped Na integrates into the SrSiO               3               structure to form Na               x               Sr               1-x               SiO               3-0.5x               , and with {$>$}10 mol\% Na doping, phase separation occurs, leading to the formation of an amorphous phase {$\beta$}-Na               2               Si               2               O               5               and a crystalline Sr-rich phase.

In addition, {$\beta$}-Na               2               Si               2               O               5               starts to crystallize at temperatures higher than 480 \textdegree C with prolonged heating, resulting in reduction in Na               +               motion, and thus degradation of ionic conductivity.

Alloying has been found to improve stability, but only in a few empirically discovered systems. We have developed a theoretical framework with which stable nanostructured alloys can be designed. A nanostructure stability map based on a thermodynamic model is applied to design stable nanostructured tungsten alloys. We identify a candidate alloy, W-Ti, and demonstrate substantially enhanced stability for the high-temperature, long-duration conditions amenable to powder-route production of bulk nanostructured tungsten. This nanostructured alloy adopts a heterogeneous chemical distribution that is anticipated by the present theoretical framework but unexpected on the basis of conventional bulk thermodynamics.},

DL allows analysis of unstructured data and automated identification of features. The recent development of large materials databases has fueled the application of DL methods in atomistic prediction in particular. In contrast, advances in image and spectral data have largely leveraged synthetic data enabled by high-quality forward models as well as by generative unsupervised DL methods. In this article, we present a high-level overview of deep learning methods followed by a detailed discussion of recent developments of deep learning in atomistic simulation, materials imaging, spectral analysis, and natural language processing. For each modality we discuss applications involving both theoretical and experimental data, typical modeling approaches with their strengths and limitations, and relevant publicly available software and datasets. We conclude the review with a discussion of recent cross-cutting work related to uncertainty quantification in this field and a brief perspective on limitations, challenges, and potential growth areas for DL methods in materials science.},

  abstract = {Lithium/air batteries, based on their high theoretical specific energy, are an extremely attractive technology for electrical energy storage that could make long-range electric vehicles widely affordable. However, the impact of this technology has so far fallen short of its potential due to several daunting challenges. In nonaqueous Li/air cells, reversible chemistry with a high current efficiency over several cycles has not yet been established, and the deposition of an electrically resistive discharge product appears to limit the capacity. Aqueous cells require water-stable lithium-protection membranes that tend to be thick, heavy, and highly resistive. Both types of cell suffer from poor oxygen redox kinetics at the positive electrode and deleterious volume and morphology changes at the negative electrode. Closed Li/air systems that include oxygen storage are much larger and heavier than open systems, but so far oxygen- and OH--selective membranes are not effective in preventing contamination of cells. In this review we discuss the most critical challenges to developing robust, high-energy Li/air batteries and suggest future research directions to understand and overcome these challenges.We predict that Li/air batteries will primarily remain a research topic for the next several years. However, if the fundamental challenges can be met, the Li/air battery has the potential to significantly surpass the energy storage capability of today's Li-ion batteries.},

However, these approaches have significant drawbacks, including inconsistency; limitations in the number of simultaneous labels because of spectral overlap; and necessary perturbations of the experiment, such as fixing the cells, to generate the measurement. Here, we show that a computational machine-learning approach, which we call ``in silico labeling'' (ISL), reliably predicts some fluorescent labels from transmitted-light images of unlabeled fixed or live biological samples. ISL predicts a range of labels, such as those for nuclei, cell type (e.g., neural), and cell state (e.g., cell death). Because prediction happens in silico, the method is consistent, is not limited by spectral overlap, and does not disturb the experiment. ISL generates biological measurements that would otherwise be problematic or impossible to acquire. In silico labeling, a machine-learning approach, reliably infers fluorescent measurements from transmitted-light images of unlabeled fixed or live biological samples.},

  abstract = {The paper presents an application of reaction-rate theory to nonradiative electron transitions in polar crystals based on a "two-site" model. For this purpose localized electronic states are described by using the adiabatic approximation. Both "large" polarons in ionic crystals and "small" polarons in molecular crystals are considered from a unified point of view. By assuming a single frequency of the lattice vibrations (Einstein model) one can calculate the transition probability for both the limits of adiabatic and nonadiabatic electron transfer as well as for the whole intermediate range. The relevant expressions, earlier derived in treating electron transfer in solution, are reviewed and discussed in order to give a justification of their application to polaron hopping in crystals. In a similar way, a review is made of the reaction-rate approach to electron transfer to obtain the appropriate rate equations for the low- and high-temperature limits and the intermediate temperature range as well. New expressions for the polaron-hopping rate are also derived. The conditions of its validity are discussed. This paper provides an essentially new approach to nonradiative electron transfer in polar crystals. It permits one to overcome the limitations of the usual methods, such as the multiphonon approach, entirely based on time-dependent perturbation theory and/or the Franck-Condon approximation which restrict their applicability only to nonadiabatic polaron hopping. The reaction-rate treatment exactly reproduces the results of the more rigorous multiphonon theory of nonadiabatic transitions. Moreover, it yields correct rate expressions for adiabatic transitions, in particular, in the high-temperature range, in which the classical occurrence-probability approach greatly overestimates the activation energy. Some problems concerning the Einstein one-frequency oscillator model assumed and the irreversibility of the electron transfer are discussed with some details from standpoint of both reaction-rate theory and multiphonon theory. The advantages of the reaction-rate approach are emphasized.},

This chapter aims to serve as a battery-related computation handbook for general readers who may be new to first-principles calculations. Specifically, this chapter will introduce the well-established ab initio modeling methods widely used in battery-related studies from both the thermodynamic and kinetics aspects. The thermodynamic approaches that will be discussed include the computations of equilibrium voltage and voltage profiles, electronic structure, and stability analyses. The kinetics approaches will cover common methods for ionic diffusion studies: transition state theory and nudged elastic band method and ab initio molecular dynamics.

By using a solar cavity-receiver reactor, we combined the oxygen uptake and release capacity of cerium oxide and facile catalysis at elevated temperatures to thermochemically dissociate CO(2) and H(2)O, yielding CO and H(2), respectively. Stable and rapid generation of fuel was demonstrated over 500 cycles.

  abstract = {The Li7P3S11 glass-ceramic is a promising superionic conductor electrolyte (SCE) with an extremely high Li + conductivity that exceeds that of even traditional organic electrolytes. In this work, we present a combined computational and experimental investigation of the material performance limitations in terms of its phase and electro- chemical stability, and Li+ conductivity. We find that Li7P3S11 is metastable at 0 K but becomes stable at above 630 K ({$\sim$}360 \textdegree C) when vibrational entropy contributions are accounted for, in agreement with differential scanning calorimetry measurements. Both scanning electron microscopy and the calculated Wulff shape show that Li7P3S11 tends to form relatively isotropic crystals. In terms of electrochemical stability, first-principles calculations predict that, unlike the LiCoO2 cathode, the olivine LiFePO4 and spinel LiMn2O4 cathodes are likely to form stable passivation interfaces with the Li7P3S11 SCE. This finding underscores the importance of considering multicomponent integration in developing an all-solid-state architecture. To probe the fundamental limit of its bulk Li+ conductivity, a comparison of conventional cold-press sintered versus spark-plasma sintering (SPS) Li7P3S11 was done in conjunction with ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations. Though the measured diffusion activation barriers are in excellent agreement, the AIMD- predicted room-temperature Li+ conductivity of 57 mS cm-1 is much higher than the experimental values. The optimized SPS sample exhibits a room-temperature Li+ conductivity of 11.6 mS cm-, significantly higher than that of the cold-pressed sample (1.3 mS cm-1) due to the reduction of grain boundary resistance by densification. We conclude that grain boundary conductivity is limiting the overall Li+ conductivity in Li7P3S11, and further optimization of overall conductivities should be possible. Finally, we show that Li+ motions in this material are highly collective, and the flexing of the P2S7 ditetrahedra facilitates fast Li+ diffusion.},

The first scheme relies on a one-to-one mapping of species in the candidate crystal structure to a known crystal structure, while the second scheme relies on data-mined minimum atom pair distances to predict the crystal volume of the candidate crystal structure and does not require a reference structure. We demonstrate that the two schemes can effectively predict the volumes within mean absolute errors (MAE) as low as 3.8\% and 8.2\%. We also discuss the various factors that may impact the performance of the schemes. Implementations for both schemes are available in the open-source pymatgen software.},

  abstract = {Sodium-ion batteries are a more sustainable alternative to the existing lithium-ion technology and could alleviate some of the stress on the global lithium market as a result of the growing electric car and portable electronics industries. Fundamental research focused on understanding the structural and electronic processes occurring on electrochemical cycling is key to devising rechargeable batteries with improved performance. We present an in-depth investigation of the effect of Mg doping on the electrochemical performance and structural stability of Na2/3MnO2 with a P2 layer stacking by comparing three compositions: Na2/3Mn1-yMgyO2 (y = 0.0, 0.05, 0.1). We show that Mg substitution leads to smoother electrochemistry, with fewer distinct electrochemical processes, improved rate performance and better capacity retention. These observations are attributed to the more gradual structural changes upon charge and discharge, as observed with synchrotron, powder X-ray, and neutron diffraction. Mg doping reduces the number of Mn3+ Jahn-Teller centers and delays the high voltage phase transition occurring in P2-Na2/3MnO2. The local structure is investigated using 23Na solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (ssNMR) spectroscopy. The ssNMR data provide direct evidence for fewer oxygen layer shearing events, leading to a stabilized P2 phase, and an enhanced Na-ion mobility up to 3.8 V vs. Na+/Na upon Mg doping. The 5\% Mg-doped phase exhibits one of the best rate performances reported to date for sodium-ion cathodes with a P2 structure, with a reversible capacity of 106 mAhg-1 at the very high discharge rate of 5000 mAg-1. In addition, its structure is highly reversible and stable cycling is obtained between 1.5 and 4.0 V vs. Na+/Na, with a capacity of approximately 140 mAhg-1 retained after 50 cycles at a rate of 1000 mAg-1.}

These materials are high-k dielectrics with degenerate or thermally activated n-type semiconductivity. Conventional super-exchange or double-exchange interactions cannot produce long-range magnetic order at concentrations of magnetic cations of a few percent. We propose that ferromagnetic exchange here, and in dilute ferromagnetic nitrides, is mediated by shallow donor electrons that form bound magnetic polarons, which overlap to create a spin-split impurity band. The Curie temperature in the mean-field approximation varies as (xdelta)(1/2) where x and delta are the concentrations of magnetic cations and donors, respectively. High Curie temperatures arise only when empty minority-spin or majority-spin d states lie at the Fermi level in the impurity band. The magnetic phase diagram includes regions of semiconducting and metallic ferromagnetism, cluster paramagnetism, spin glass and canted antiferromagnetism.},

This compound crystallizes in the P2(1)/m space group with a = 6.41 A, b = 3.77 A, c = 8.08 A, and beta = 92 degrees . It exhibits |TiNbO5|(infinity) layers similar to HTiNbO5, but differs from the latter by a "parallel configuration" of its |TiNbO6|(infinity) ribbons between the two successive layers. The topotactic character of the reaction suggests that exfoliation plays a prominent role in the synthesis of this new form. This new phase intercalates reversibly 0.8 lithium through a first-order transformation leading to a capacity of 94 mAh/g at a potential of 1.67 V vs Li/Li+.},

  abstract = {The discovery of new materials is hampered by the lack of efficient approaches to the exploration of both the large number of possible elemental compositions for such materials, and of the candidate structures at each composition 1 . For example, the discovery of inorganic extended solid structures has relied on knowledge of crystal chemistry coupled with time-consuming materials synthesis with systematically varied elemental ratios 2,3 . Computational methods have been developed to guide synthesis by predicting structures at specific compositions 4\textendash 6 and predicting compositions for known crystal structures 7,8 , with notable successes 9,10 . However, the challenge of finding qualitatively new, experimentally realizable compounds, with crystal structures where the unit cell and the atom positions within it differ from known structures, remains for compositionally complex systems. Many valuable properties arise from substitution into known crystal structures, but materials discovery using this approach alone risks both missing best-in-class performance and attempting design with incomplete knowledge 8,11 . Here we report the experimental discovery of two structure types by computational identification of the region of a complex inorganic phase field that contains them. This is achieved by computing probe structures that capture the chemical and structural diversity of the system and whose energies can be ranked against combinations of currently known materials. Subsequent experimental exploration of the lowest-energy regions of the computed phase diagram affords two materials with previously unreported crystal structures featuring unusual structural motifs. This approach will accelerate the systematic discovery of new materials in complex compositional spaces by efficiently guiding synthesis and enhancing the predictive power of the computational tools through expansion of the knowledge base underpinning them.},

Recent applications are reviewed, and an extensive set of new results presented on transition metal compounds. The features of the electronic density and of several calculated properties are examined as the weight of the HF (exact) exchange in the hybrid functional is increased. Clear trends emerge in the structural and electronic properties; in particular, HF exchange increases the electronic localisation. This features causes an increase in the ionicity of the materials, a systematic decrease of the lattice parameter and increase of the elastic constants and bulk moduli. When HF and standard (LDA or GGA) DFT solutions yield systematically results with opposite sign with respect to experiment, the formulation of hybrid functionals improves the accuracy of the calculations. This is the case for band gaps, phonon spectra, magnetic coupling constants, and all properties that depend on the extent of electronic localisation at either perfect or defective lattice sites. A different weight of HF exchange is required to reproduce the experimental value of different observables; as a general rule, however, a higher fraction of HF exchange than the 20\% optimised in the molecular B3LYP formulation is required in the solid state.},

Phys. 112, 7374 2000 of thermochemical data for validation of quantum chemical methods is expanded to include 78 additional energies including 14 enthalpies of formation of the first- and second-row nonhydrogen molecules, 58 energies of molecules containing the third-row elements K, Ca, and Ga\textendash Kr, and 6 hydrogen-bonded complexes. The criterion used for selecting the additional systems is the same as before, i.e., experimental uncertainties less than {$\pm$}1 kcal/mol. This new set, referred to as the G3/05 test set, has a total of 454 energies. The G3 and G3X theories are found to have mean absolute deviations of 1.13 and 1.01 kcal/mol, respectively, when applied to the G3/05 test set. Both methods have larger errors for the nonhydrogen subset of 79 species for which they have mean absolute deviations of 2.10 and 1.64 kcal/mol, respectively. On all of the other types of energies the G3 and G3X methods are very reliable. The G3/05 test set is also used to assess density-functional methods including a series of new functionals. The most accurate functional for the G3/05 test set is B98 with a mean absolute deviation of 3.33 kcal/mol, compared to 4.14 kcal/mol for B3LYP. The latter functional has especially large errors for larger molecules with a mean absolute deviation of 9 kcal/mol for molecules having 28 or more valence electrons. For smaller molecules B3LYP does as well or better than B98 and the other functionals. It is found that many of the density-functional methods have significant errors for the larger molecules in the test set.},

These molecules were taken from the Gaussian-2 (G2) extended test set for third-row atoms. Several different schemes were used to extrapolate the calculated energies to the complete basis set (CBS) limit for CCSD(T) and the Kohn-Sham (KS) limit for B3LYP. Zero point energy and spin orbital corrections were included in the results. Overall, CCSD(T) atomization energies, ionization energies, proton affinities, and electron affinities are in good agreement with experiment, within 1.1 kcal/mol when the CBS limit has been determined using a series of two basis sets of at least triple zeta quality. For B3LYP, the overall mean absolute deviation from experiment for the three properties and the series of molecules is more significant at the KS limit, within 2.3 and 2.6 kcal/mol for the cc-pVnZ and aug-cc-pVnZ basis set series, respectively.},

In light of this observation, we present an efficient real-space method to correct periodic-image errors, based on a multigrid solver for the potential difference, and demonstrate that exponential convergence of the energy with respect to cell size can be achieved in practical calculations. Additionally, we derive rapidly convergent expansions for determining the Madelung constants of point-charge assemblies in one, two, and three dimensions.},

The calculated C-O stretching frequencies are found to be in excellent agreement with spectroscopic measurements. The frequency shifts that take place when the surface is covered with ruthenium monolayers are also correctly predicted. This agreement for both shifts and absolute vibrational frequencies is made more remarkable by the frequent failure of local and semilocal exchange-correlation functionals in predicting the stability of the different adsorption sites for CO on transition metal surfaces. We have investigated the chemical origin of the C-O frequency shifts introducing an orbital-resolved analysis of the force and frequency density of states, and assessed the effect of donation and backdonation on the CO vibrational frequency using a GGA+molecular U approach. These findings rationalize and establish the accuracy of density-functional calculations in predicting absolute vibrational frequencies, notwithstanding the failure in determining relative adsorption energies, in the strong chemisorption regime.},

For x\textbackslash textless0.04, the intercalated Li is randomly distributed throughout the graphite host in a dilute stage-1 phase. As x increases past 0.04, a clear coexistence between this phase and a stage-4 phase is observed. As x increases further at 21 \textdegree C, transitions to stage 3, to a ``liquidlike'' stage-2 phase (denoted 2L), to stage 2, and finally to filled stage 1 occur sequentially as expected on the basis of previous work. We have been able to accurately determine the ranges in x and in T of the single-phase and the coexisting-phase regions. Clear coexisting-phase regions are observed (indicating first-order transitions) for all the transitions except for the stage-4 to -3 transition. We discuss the difference between this transition and the others. The average layer spacing of LixC6 has been measured as a function of x.},

The temperature at which oxygen evolution occurs depends on x and on the material. Using thermal gravimetric analysis and mass spectrometry, we have studied the thermal decomposition of these materials in inert gas. We find that the nickel materials are least stable, the manganese compounds are most stable, and that the cobalt compounds show intermediate behaviour. These results have important consequences for the safety of Li-ion cells, and suggest that cells using LiMn2O4 as the cathode should be safer than those using LiNiO2 or LiCoO2.},

Presently available white light-emitting diodes emit with extremely high luminance because their emission areas are much smaller than those of conventional light sources. Consequently, white light-emitting diodes produce a glare that is uncomfortable to the human eye. Here we report a yellow-emitting phosphor, the Eu(2+)-doped chlorometasilicate (Ca(1-x-y,)Sr(x,)Eu(y))(7)(SiO(3))(6)Cl(2), which can be used to create glareless white light-emitting diodes. The (Ca(1-x-y,)Sr(x,)Eu(y))(7)(SiO(3))(6)Cl(2) exhibits a large Stokes shift, efficiently converting violet excitation light to yellow luminescence, and phosphors based on this host material have much less blue absorption than other phosphors. We used crystal structure analysis to determine the origin of the desired luminescence, and we used (Ca(1-x-y,)Sr(x,)Eu(y))(7)(SiO(3))(6)Cl(2) and a blue-emitting phosphor in combination with a violet chip to fabricate glareless white light-emitting diodes that have large emission areas and are suitable for general illumination.},

  abstract = {Combinatorial synthesis and screening of very large numbers of organic compounds has been widely applied in the pharma- ceutical industry for drug discovery1 . Recently, combinatorial arrays of inorganic materials with known or potential super- conductivity2 and giant magnetoresistance3 have been synthesized and screened. The combinatorial approach is particularly well suited to ternary and higher-order inorganic materials, for which efforts to predict basic properties have been unsuccessful4 . Here we describe an automated combinatorial method for synthesizing and characterizing thin-film libraries of up to 25,000 different materials, on a three-inch-diameter substrate, as candidates for new phosphors. The discovery and development of new compounds for ultraviolet-excited phosphors is of great importance for the development of flat-panel displays5 and lighting6 . As there are no reliable theories to predict the relation between composition and phosphor colour and efficiency, the less than 100 useful commercial phosphor materials have been discovered through one-by-one serial synthesis and testing7,8 . Our approach, in contrast, offers rapid screening of many composi- tions, and it has enabled us to identify a new red phosphor, Y0.845Al0.070La0.060Eu0.025VO4, which has a quantum efficiency comparable or superior to those of existing commercial red phosphors.},

The emission maximum at 485 nanometers appears blue-white and has a quantum yield of 0.48 +/- 0.02.

The material was obtained in two different morphologies by a double-step route, which is cheap and easy to scale up: the hydrothermal synthesis to produce Co(3)O(4) with tailored and nanometric morphology, followed by the solid-state reaction with NaOH, or alternatively with Na(2)CO(3), to promote Na intercalation. Both products are highly crystalline and have the P2-Na(0.71)CoO(2) crystal phase, but differ in the respective morphologies. The material obtained from Na(2)CO(3) have a narrow particle length (edge to edge) distribution and 2D platelet morphology, while those from NaOH exhibit large microcrystals, irregular in shape, with broad particle length distribution and undefined exposed surfaces. Electrochemical analysis shows the good performances of these materials as a positive electrode for Na-ion half cells. In particular, Na(0.71)CoO(2) thin microplatelets exhibit the best behavior with stable discharge specific capacities of 120 and 80 mAh g(-1) at 5 and 40 mA g(-1), respectively, in the range 2.0-3.9 V vs. Na(+)/Na. These outstanding properties make this material a promising candidate to construct viable and high-performance Na-based batteries.},

We investigate the convergence of the surface energy as a function of the number of layers in the slab, using the Cu(1 1 1) surface as an example. The results show that the surface energy, as obtained using total energies of the slab and bulk from separate calculations, converges well with respect to the number of layers in the slab. Obviously, it is necessary that bulk and surface calculations are performed with the same high accuracy. Furthermore, we discuss the performance of the local-density and generalized gradient approximations for the exchange-correlation functional in describing the various surface properties. ?? 2005 Elsevier B.V.

  abstract = {Comprehensive understanding of the charge transport mechanism in the intrinsic structure of an electrode material is essential in accounting for its electrochemical performance. We present here systematic experimental and theoretical investigations of Li+-ion diffusion in a novel layered material, viz. lithium titanium niobate. Lithium titanium niobate (exact composition Li0.55K0.45TiNbO5{$\cdot$}1.06H2O) is obtained from sol\textendash gel synthesized potassium titanium niobate (KTiNbO5) by an ion-exchange method. The Li+-ions are inserted and de-inserted preferentially into the galleries between the octahedral layers formed by edge and corner sharing TiO6 and NbO6 octahedral units and the effective chemical diffusion coefficient, is estimated to be 3.8 \texttimes{} 10-11 cm2 s-1 using the galvanostatic intermittent titration technique (GITT). Calculations based on density functional theory (DFT) strongly confirm the anisotropic Li+-ion diffusion in the interlayer galleries and that Li+-ions predominantly diffuse along the crystallographic b-direction. The preferential Li+-ion diffusion along the b-direction is assisted by line-defects, which are observed to be higher in concentration along the b-direction compared to the a- and c-directions, as revealed by high resolution electron microscopy. The Li\textendash Ti niobate can be cycled to low voltages ({$\approx$}0.2 V) and show stable and satisfactory battery performance over 100 cycles. Due to the possibility of cycling to low voltages, cyclic voltammetry and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy convincingly reveal the reversibility of Ti3+ {$\leftrightarrow$} Ti2+ along with Ti4+ {$\leftrightarrow$} Ti3+ and Nb5+ {$\leftrightarrow$} Nb4+.},

  abstract = {Kinetic pathways of Li-ion diffusion in olivine phosphates are calculated from density functional theory (DFT). Previously reported theoretical diffusion rates for Li ions and vacancies in defect-free crystalline FePO4 and LiFePO4 are six orders of magnitude faster than experimentally measured values. This discrepancy can be resolved by considering the different components of Li kinetics, including diffusion in the bulk, on the surface, in the presence of defects, and in varying local environments. Using DFT+U, we quantify each of these effects and determine that, while bulk diffusion is affected by strain and Li concentration, these are not significant enough to explain the slow diffusion observed in experiment. However, surface diffusion is observed to have have high barriers, which could contribute to slow kinetics in nanostructured cathodes. Anti-site defects also provide a possible explanation for slow diffusion, but only for vacancy diffusion in LiFePO4, which has a barrier of 0.71 eV, compared to 0.29 eV in defect-free channels. In FePO4, a concerted Li-ion diffusion mechanism around the anti-site defect is found to have a low barrier of 0.35 eV, allowing for facile cross-channel diffusion at room temperature. The difference between Li-ion and vacancy diffusion is understood in terms of a favorable coordination between Li ions and localized electrons on Fe centers at the transition states for Li-ion hopping in FePO4. Greater distances between vacancies and holes at the transition states for vacancy diffusion lead to higher diffusion barriers.},

The force field is compatible with the \{AMBER\} methodology and is easily extendable to other dialkylimidazolium salts. On the basis of the general \{AMBER\} procedures to develop lacking intramolecular parameters and the \{RESP\} approach to calculate the atomic point charges, we obtained an all-atom force field which was validated against the experimental density, diffusion coefficient, vibrational frequencies, as well as X-ray (crystal state) and neutron (liquid state) diffraction structural data. Moreover, molecular mechanics calculations for the developed force field produce the cation's structures and dipole moments in very good agreement with quantum mechanical ab initio calculations. In addition, a basic study concerning the simulated liquid structure in terms of the radial distribution functions has been undertaken using molecular dynamics simulation. In summary, we achieved a very consistent picture in the computed data for the four room-temperature molten salts.},

Well-aligned mats of multi-walled carbon nanotubes were observed in samples catalyzed with iron, nickel, and cobalt. Nanotube lengths could be varied between 3 lm and 3 mm, and diameters ranged from 20 nm to 60 nm. X-ray diffraction, energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, and Mossbauer spectroscopy were used to determine the compositions of the nanotube products. None of the other elements studied, consisting of Cr, Mn, Zn, Cd, Ti, Zr, La, Cu, V, and Gd, were able to successfully catalyze the growth of CNTs. A study was performed of the respective metal\textendash carbon binary phase diagrams to understand why the catalytic ability of different elements varied. Successful catalysts had carbon solubility limits of 0.5 wt.\% to 1.5 wt.\% carbon, followed closely by nanotube growth through graphite precipitation. Unsuccessful catalysts were found to have either nearly zero carbon solubility, or to form numerous intermediate carbides, making it difficult for the diffusion required for graphite precipitation to occur. These findings were then used to look for other potential CNT catalysts by examining the phase diagrams of a wide variety of metals.},

Pure V exhibits an anomalous anharmonic stiffening of phonons with increasing temperature. This anharmonicity is suppressed by Co and Pt, but not by isoelectronic Nb solutes. The changes in phonon frequency with alloying and with temperature both correlate to the decrease in electron density of states DOS at the Fermi level as calculated using density functional theory. The effects of both temperature and alloying can be understood in terms of an adiabatic electron-phonon interaction EPI, which broadens sharp features in the electron DOS. These results show that the adiabatic EPI can influence the phonon thermodynamics at temperatures exceeding 1000 K, and that thermal trends of phonons may help assess the strength of the EPI.},

  abstract = {Lithium nickel oxide exhibits a departure from stoichiometry (Li1 - zNi1 + zO2) consisting in the presence of extra-nickel ions within the lithium sites. Using optimized experimental synthesis conditions, compositions very close to the ideal stoichiometry (z = 0.02) can be obtained. By using the sensitivity of the lithium site isotropic temperature factor to the stoichiometry, the amount of extra-nickel ions can be determined in a very precise way. The loss of reversibility at the first cycle is mainly related to the change in the oxidation state of the extra-nickel ions, which induces a local collapse of the structure and makes difficult the lithium re-intercalation. A systematic structural study of LixNiO2 phases has been performed by extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) as well as X-ray and electron diffraction. In the case of the starting Li0.98Ni1.02O2 phase, a local distortion of the NiO6 octahedra, resulting from a dynamic Jahn-Teller effect of low spin trivalent nickel ions has been evidenced from the EXAFS study. For the partially de-intercalated materials (0.50 \textbackslash textless x \textbackslash textless 0.75) which crystallize in the monoclinic system, the EXAFS study shows that the NiO6 octahedra are only slightly distorted due to the occurrence of a hopping phenomenon between NiIV and NiIII. Electron diffraction experiments show the existence of a superstructure due to a peculiar lithium-ion ordering. Systematic electrochemical studies have shown that this ordering is strongly sensititve to the presence of extra-nickel ions.},

Discharge potentials (2.0\textbackslash textlessV\textbackslash textless3.5V) have been measured as a function of the composition. The electrochemical intercalation of sodium in all these materials is reversible within their existence range. During the electrochemical intercalation a reversible charge is observed between phases having AABBCC and ABCABC oxygen packing. This can be explained by the relatively small displacement of the sheets. In contrast, for the material with AABB oxygen packing no transition occurs since a packing change requires breaking of cobalt-oxygen bonds, which is apparently impossible at room temperature.},

In this work, we present a rational composition optimization strategy for maximizing the Li+ conductivity in the LRAP guided by a combination of firstprinciples calculations and percolation theory. Using nudged elastic band (NEB) calculations, we show that a Cl-rich channel with Br-rich end points configuration leads to low vacancy migration barriers in the LRAP structure. By incorporating the halide-environment-dependent NEB barriers in a bond percolation model, we predict that there are potentially higher conductivity Li3OCl1-xBrx structures near 0.235 {$\leq$} x {$\leq$} 0.395. This prediction is confirmed by AIMD simulation that finds Li3OCl0.75Br0.25 to have a higher Li+ conductivity than Li3OCl0.5Br0.5, the highest conductivity LRAP identified experimentally thus far. These results highlight that there is scope for further enhancing the conductivity in the LRAP chemistry. The general approach developed can potentially be extended to other ion-conducting systems, such as the structurally similar perovskite oxygen-ion conductors of interest in solid-oxide fuel cells as well as other superionic conductors.},

  abstract = {This work focuses on the intrinsic electron transport in stoichiometric TiO2. Electron hopping is described by a polaron model, whereby a negative polaron is localized at a Ti3+ site and hops to an adjacent Ti4+ site. Polaron hopping is described via Marcus theory formulated for polaronic systems and quasiequivalent to the Emin-Holstein-Austin-Mott theory. We obtain the relevant parameters in the theory (namely, the activation energy {$\Delta$}G*, the reorganization energy {$\lambda$}, and the electronic coupling matrix elements VAB) for selected crystallographic directions in rutile and anatase, using periodic density functional theory (DFT)+U and Hartree-Fock cluster calculations. The DFT+U method was required to correct the well-known electron self-interaction error in DFT for the calculation of polaronic wave functions. Our results give nonadiabatic activation energies of similar magnitude in rutile and anatase, all near {$\sim$}0.3 eV. The electronic coupling matrix element VAB was determined to be largest for polaron hopping parallel to the c direction in rutile and indicative of adiabatic transfer (thermal hopping mechanism) with a value of 0.20 eV, while the other directions investigated in both rutile and anatase gave VAB values of about one order of magnitude smaller and indicative of diabatic transfer (tunneling mechanism) in anatase.},

Calculations are made on the dependence of the fluorescence yield on concentration, and to indicate typical activator concentrations at which appreciable quenching may be expected to occur. If the transition in the activator is of the electric dipole or electric quadrupole type, appreciable quenching may arise when the activator concentration is 10-3 to 10-2; if it is a magnetic dipole transition, transfer will occur by exchange, rather than by overlapping of magnetic dipole fields, and the critical concentration will be of the order of a few percent. The implications of transfer phenomena upon the observed absence of luminescence in most ``pure'' inorganic crystals are discussed, and it is concluded that transfer rates are so high in strongly absorbing crystals that the energy can easily migrate to a very few sinks dispersed throughout the lattice.},

However, a major challenge is their lower energy density. In this work, we report a novel multi-electron cathode material, KVOPO4 , for sodium ion batteries. Due to the unique polyhedral framework, the V3+ {$\leftrightarrow$} V4+ {$\leftrightarrow$} V5+ redox couple was for the first time fully activated by sodium ions in a vanadyl phosphate phase. The KVOPO4 based cathode delivered reversible multiple sodium (i.e. maximum 1.66 Na + per formula unit) storage capability, which leads to a high specific capacity of 235 Ah kg-1 . Combining an average voltage of 2.56 V vs. Na/Na + , a high practical energy density of over 600 Wh kg-1 was achieved, the highest yet reported for any sodium cathode material. The cathode exhibits a very small volume change upon cycling (1.4\% for 0.64 sodium and 8.0\% for 1.66 sodium ions). Density functional theory (DFT) calculations indicate that the KVOPO4 framework is a 3D ionic conductor with a reasonably, low Na+ migration energy barrier of {$\approx$}450 meV, in line with the good rate capability obtained.},

  abstract = {High-entropy alloys (HEAs) are an intriguing new class of metallic materials due to their unique mechanical behavior. Achieving a detailed understanding of structure\textendash property relationships in these materials has been challenged by the compositional disorder that underlies their unique mechanical behavior. Accordingly, in this work, we employ first-principles calculations to investigate the nature of local chemical order and establish its relationship to the intrinsic and extrinsic stacking fault energy (SFE) in CrCoNi medium-entropy solid-solution alloys, whose combination of strength, ductility, and toughness properties approaches the best on record. We find that the average intrinsic and extrinsic SFE are both highly tunable, with values ranging from -43 to 30 mJ{$\cdot$}m-2 and from -28 to 66 mJ{$\cdot$}m-2, respectively, as the degree of local chemical order increases. The state of local ordering also strongly correlates with the energy difference between the face-centered cubic (fcc) and hexagonal close-packed (hcp) phases, which affects the occurrence of transformation-induced plasticity. This theoretical study demonstrates that chemical short-range order is thermodynamically favored in HEAs and can be tuned to affect the mechanical behavior of these alloys. It thus addresses the pressing need to establish robust processing\textendash structure\textendash property relationships to guide the science-based design of new HEAs with targeted mechanical behavior.},

  abstract = {Measurements of Faraday rotation (FR) in [001]-oriented epitaxial films of SrTi1xFexO3 and SrTi1xCoxO3 with x{$\frac{1}{4}$}0.4 and 0.3, respectively, indicate that FR constants (103 deg/cm) of these perovskite compounds can approach those of (Bi,Y)3Fe5O12 garnet used in fiber-optical isolators at a wavelength of 1.5 lm. Because the magnetic site in a stoichiometric host is occupied by Ti4\th, substituted Fe or Co must also be 4\th. A reduction to Fe3\th, Fe2\th, and Co3\th, Co2\th{} is also expected from O2\textendash{} loss during the deposition process. The orbital energy-level structures in an octahedral site are examined for the existence of transitions that could account for the similar high FR effects. It was determined that only Fe4\th{} and Co4\th{} in low-spin states can satisfy the selection rules. The observation that the respective coercive fields of the FR(H) hysteresis loops exceed those of the magnetic moment M(H) lends credence to the argument that the unquenched orbital angular momentum acting with spin-orbit coupling can become the dominating influence on collective magnetic alignment.},

By expansion to second order in a carefully chosen quantity contained in the long-range part of the correlation functional, the nonlocal correlations are expressed in terms of a density-density interaction formula. It contains a relatively simple parametrized kernel, with parameters determined by the local density and its gradient. The proposed functional is applied to rare gas and benzene dimers, where it is shown to give a realistic description.},

In this work, we demonstrate through experimental characterization and theoretical analysis that LiTi2(PS4)3 or LTPS shows exceptional Li-ion diffusion, an order of magnitude higher than current state-of-the-art superionic conductors. We propose a rationalization to this behavior by the frustrated energy landscape experienced by lithium ions in the LTPS framework. LTPS shows a unique crystal structure with no regular tetrahedral or octahedral sites for lithium to favorably occupy. This leads to a smooth energy landscape combining small energy barriers with numerous diffusion paths. This energy landscape is closer to a liquid than typical crystalline solids and is at the root of the exceptional diffusion behavior in LTPS. The concept of a crystalline framework with frustrated energy landscape offers an entirely new design principle to guide the search of future high performance superionic conductors.},

  abstract = {Phosphor-converted white-light-emitting diodes (pc-WLEDs) are rapidly becoming more popular in the lighting industry due to their energy savings, long lifetimes and environmentally friendly characteristics. The color rendering index (CRI, Ra) and the visual energy efficiency (luminous efficacy of radiation, LER) are the critical criteria to be considered when developing novel red phosphors for use in warm white pc-WLEDs to replace incandescent and fluorescent lamps. In this regard, narrow-band red-emitting materials have been intensively developed in terms of the CRI and LER in an effort to compliment the red deficiency of the widely commercialized Y3Al5O12:Ce 3+ (YAG) phosphor-based pc-WLEDs. However, CRIs are limited in their inability to guarantee good saturated colors of illuminated objects under a warm white color. Instead of using CRI values as criteria, a two-measure system encompassing the color fidelity score (Rf) and the color gamut score (Rg) was developed and adopted as Illuminating Engineering Society of North America (IES) technical memorandum TM-30-2015 for correct evaluations of the color rendition and to guide the optimization of LED light sources. In this review, we summarize the recent findings on novel narrow-band red phosphors, the improved color and visual energy properties of these phosphors, and their ability to improve the optical properties of corresponding warm white pc-WLED lightings. To solve the complex problem of overestimations of high-CRI values, we discuss the ways in which the narrow-band red phosphors affect the new color metrics (Rf, Rg, and color icon) and the LERs of tri-color pc-WLEDs while varying the narrow scale and blue-shifted peak position of red phosphors. These new color metrics and LER criteria provide guidelines with which many material and chemistry researchers can develop new red phosphors by optimizing the crystal structure, crystal rigidity, local symmetry, the number of available sites for activators, the selection of the host and activator, and other factors.},

Despite the tremendous recent advances in battery research, surprisingly, several fundamental issues of increasing practical importance have not been adequately tackled. One such issue concerns the energy efficiency. Generally, charging of 10(10)-10(17) electrode particles constituting a modern battery electrode proceeds at (much) higher voltages than discharging. Most importantly, the hysteresis between the charge and discharge voltage seems not to disappear as the charging/discharging current vanishes. Herein we present, for the first time, a general explanation of the occurrence of inherent hysteretic behaviour in insertion storage systems containing multiple particles. In a broader sense, the model also predicts the existence of apparent equilibria in battery electrodes, the sequential particle-by-particle charging/discharging mechanism and the disappearance of two-phase behaviour at special experimental conditions.},

However, the non-local nature of the interactions between valence electrons and lattice ions, often compounded by a plethora of vibrational modes, presents formidable challenges for attempts to experimentally control and theoretically describe the physical properties of complex materials. Here we report a Raman scattering study of the lattice dynamics in superlattices of the high-temperature superconductor YBa(2)Cu(3)O(7) (YBCO) and the colossal-magnetoresistance compound La(2/3)Ca(1/3)MnO(3) that suggests a new approach to this problem. We find that a rotational mode of the MnO(6) octahedra in La(2/3)Ca(1/3)MnO(3) experiences pronounced superconductivity-induced line-shape anomalies, which scale linearly with the thickness of the YBCO layers over a remarkably long range of several tens of nanometres. The transfer of the electron-phonon coupling between superlattice layers can be understood as a consequence of long-range Coulomb forces in conjunction with an orbital reconstruction at the interface. The superlattice geometry thus provides new opportunities for controlled modification of the electron-phonon interaction in complex materials.},

  abstract = {Because of their loosely bound electrons, electrides offer physical properties useful in chemical synthesis and electronics. For these applications and others, nanosized electrides offer advantages, but to-date no electride has been synthesized as a nanomaterial. We demonstrate experimentally that Ca2N, a layered electride in which layers of atoms are separated by layers of a 2D electron gas (2DEG), can be exfoliated into two-dimensional (2D) nanosheets using liquid exfoliation. The 2D flakes are stable in a nitrogen atmosphere or in select organic solvents for at least one month. Electron microscopy and elemental analysis reveal that the 2D flakes retain the crystal structure and stoichiometry of the parent 3D Ca2N. In addition, the 2D flakes exhibit metallic character and an optical response that agrees with DFT calculations. Together these findings suggest that the 2DEG is preserved in the 2D material. With this work, we bring electrides into the nanoregime and experimentally demonstrate a 2D electride, Ca(2)dN.},

Here we examine the thermal properties of the CH3NH3PbX3 (X=I or Cl) perovskite using thermogravimetric anal. The role of the precursors is exposed and the effect of the formation of excess org. species is investigated. The sublimation behavior of the org. component is intensively scrutinized.

Both electrolytes belong to the currently highly topical class of solids comprising group I, IV, V, and VI atoms, which we summarize as 1-4-5-6 electrolytes. Herein, they are compared to each other with regard to their structural characteristics and the resulting ion transport properties. The lower activation energy of Na+ ion transport in NaSnPSe is well in line with the results of speed of sound measurements, Raman spectroscopy, bond-valance site energy calculations and molecular dynamics simulations, all of which point to a lower lattice rigidity and to weaker Na-chalcogen interactions as compared to NaSnPS.},

We find that mobile Li-ion vacancies are stabilized by removing oxygen from the lattice, which, in turn, causes the rebonding of nearby phosphate groups to form O3P-O-PO3 POP structures embedded in the crystal. In the presence of nitrogen in the system, the POP structures can be further stabilized by replacing the bridging oxygen with nitrogen. We examine the electronic and geometric structures of these stable POP and O3P-N-PO3 PNP defects which are prototypes of chain structures found in thin-film lithium phosphorus oxynitride LiPON electrolytes. We also find that mobile interstitial Li ions are stabilized by N or Si dopants substituting for O or P host ions and forming PO3N or SiO4 defects, respectively. In all of these cases, the defect not only stabilizes extrinsic mobile ions but also provides traps for the ions to escape into the bulk regions of the crystal by as much as 1.5 eV for the vacancies and 0.9 eV for the interstitials. On the other hand, migration barriers for diffusion steps near the defects are as small as 0.4\textendash 0.6 eV for the vacancies and 0.2\textendash 0.3 eV for the interstitials. Extrapolating our results to crystals with appreciable concentrations of defects, we find that our results compare favorably with experimental migration energies reported in the literature.},

We have carried out first-principles simulations of related crystalline materials as a first step toward understanding the sources of stability and mechanisms of Li-ion conductivity in these materials. In addition to a comprehensive survey of known crystalline materials related to LiPON, we have also predicted some materials. For example, starting with crystalline LiPO3 which has twisted phosphate chains, we considered the possibility of modifying the structure by substituting N and Li for O. The optimized structures were computed to have regularized phosphate chains which form planar -P-N-P-N- backbones. To the best of our knowledge, the predicted crystals, which we call s1-Li2PO2N with a 24-atom unit cell and s2-Li2PO2N with a 12-atom unit cell, have not yet been observed experimentally. We suggest several possible exothermic reaction pathways to synthesize these crystals.},

We have used first-principles modeling techniques based on densityfunctional theory and the nudged elastic band method to examine possible Li ion diffusion mechanisms in idealized crystals of the electrolyte material Li3PO4 in both the and crystalline forms, considering both vacancy and interstitial processes to find the migration energies Em. We find that interstitial diffusion via an interstitialcy mechanism involving the concerted motion of an interstitial Li ion and a neighboring lattice Li ion may provide the most efficient ion transport in Li3PO4. Ion transport in undoped crystals depends on the formation of vacancy-interstitial pairs requiring an additional energy Ef, which results in a thermal activation energy EA=Em+Ef /2. The calculated values of EA are in excellent agreement with single crystal measurements on -Li3PO4. Our results examine the similarities and differences between the diffusion processes in the and crystal structures. In addition, we analyze the zone center phonon modes in both crystals in order to further validate our calculations with experimental measurements and to determine the range of vibrational frequencies associated with Li ion motions which might contribute to the diffusion processes.},

Tasks include predicting optical, thermal, electronic, thermodynamic, tensile, and elastic properties given a material's composition and/or crystal structure. The reference algorithm, Automatminer, is a highly-extensible, fully automated ML pipeline for predicting materials properties from materials primitives (such as composition and crystal structure) without user intervention or hyperparameter tuning. We test Automatminer on the Matbench test suite and compare its predictive power with state-of-the-art crystal graph neural networks and a traditional descriptor-based Random Forest model. We find Automatminer achieves the best performance on 8 of 13 tasks in the benchmark.

High-temperature CO 2 absorption looping has emerged as a technology that has the potential to deliver much lower energy penalties, but further work is needed to find and develop an optimal material. We have developed a combined computational and experimental methodology to predict new materials that should have desirable properties for CCS looping, and then select promising candidates to experimentally validate these predictions. This work not only has discovered novel materials for use in high-temperature CCS looping, but analysis of the entirety of the screening enables greater insights into new design strategies for future development.},

  abstract = {The development of electron energy-loss spectroscopy within the last 15 years has been remarkable. This progress is partly due to improvements in instrumentation, such as the successful correction of spherical (and more recently chromatic) aberra- tion of electron lenses, allowing sub-Angstrom spatial resolution inTEMandSTEM images and (in combination with Schottky and field-emission sources) much higher current in a focused probe. The incorporation of monochromators in commercial TEMs has improved the energy resolution to 0.1 eV, with further improvements promised. These advances have required close attention to the mechanical and elec- trical stability of the TEM, including thermal, vibrational, and acoustical isolation. The energy-loss spectrometer has been improved with a fast electrostatic shutter, allowing millisecond acquisition of an entire spectrum and almost simultaneous recording of the low-loss and core-loss regions. Advances in computer software have made routine such processes as spectral and spatial deconvolution, spectrum-imaging, and multivariate statistical analysis. Programs for implementing density functional and multiple-scattering calculations to predict spectral fine structure have become more widely available. Taken together, these improvements have helped to ensure that EELS can be applied to real materials problems as well as model systems; the technique is no longer mainly a playground for physicists. Another consequence is that radiation damage is seen to be a limiting factor in electron beam microanalysis. One response has the development of TEMs that can achieve atomic resolution at lower accelerat- ing voltage, in an attempt to maximize the information/damage ratio. There is also considerable interest in the use of lasers in combination with TEM-EELS, the aim being picosecond or femtosecond time resolution, in order to study excited states and perhaps even to conquer radiation damage. For the third edition of this textbook, I have kept the previous structure intact. However, the reading list and historical section of Chapter 1 have been updated. In Chapter 2, I have retained but shortened the discussion of serial recording, making room for more information on monochromator designs and new electron detectors. In Chapter 3, I have added material on energy losses due to elastic scat- tering, retardation and Cerenkov effects, core excitation in anisotropic materials, and the delocalization of inelastic scattering.

  abstract = {We report new solid state and hydrothermal synthetic routes to (Li,Na)2FePO4F that incorporate carbon-containing additives and result in good electrochemical properties of this Li (or Na) ion electrode material. Single crystal X-ray diffraction analysis of Na2FePO4F prepared by flux growth confirms the unusual structural features of this compound that include pairs of face-sharing metal octahedra and [6 \th{} 1] coordination of the sodium ions. Facile Na-Li ion-exchange occurs upon reflux with lithium salts, upon electrochemical cycling in a cell (vs. Li), and also in a cell simply equilibrated at OCV. The material does not exhibit typical two-phase behavior on electrochemical cycling. A combination of a redox process which occurs with little structural strain, and ion scrambling give rise to a solid solution-like sloping voltage profile on charge-discharge, although localization of the Fe2\th/3\th{} in the mixed valence single phase intermediate, Na1.5FePO4F drives a very small structural distortion. Temperature-dependentM\texteuro ossbauer spectroscopy measurements confirm this localization, at least on short time scales (10-8 s), which persists to 370 C. Finally, polycrystalline powders of other members of this family of compounds (Na2CoPO4F, Na2NiPO4F) were synthesized for the first time. Na2CoPO4F has a Co2\th{} /Co3\th{} potential near 4.8 V.Mixed-metal phosphates of the form Na2(Fe1-xMx)PO4F, where M = Co, Mg, were also synthesized and found to be promising positive electrode materials for Li-ion or Na-ion energy storage devices.},

Only one member of this class\textendash the olivine LiFePO(4) (ref. 3)\textendash has risen to prominence so far, owing to its other characteristics, which include low cost, low environmental impact and safety. These are critical for large-capacity systems such as plug-in hybrid electric vehicles. Nonetheless, olivine has some inherent shortcomings, including one-dimensional lithium-ion transport and a two-phase redox reaction that together limit the mobility of the phase boundary. Thus, nanocrystallites are key to enable fast rate behaviour. It has also been suggested that the long-term economic viability of large-scale Li-ion energy storage systems could be ultimately limited by global lithium reserves, although this remains speculative at present. (Current proven world reserves should be sufficient for the hybrid electric vehicle market, although plug-in hybrid electric vehicle and electric vehicle expansion would put considerable strain on resources and hence cost effectiveness.) Here, we report on a sodium/lithium iron phosphate, A(2)FePO(4)F (A=Na, Li), that could serve as a cathode in either Li-ion or Na-ion cells. Furthermore, it possesses facile two-dimensional pathways for Li+ transport, and the structural changes on reduction-oxidation are minimal. This results in a volume change of only 3.7\% that\textendash unlike the olivine\textendash contributes to the absence of distinct two-phase behaviour during redox, and a reversible capacity that is 85\% of theoretical.},

  abstract = {Transition metal phosphates such as LiFePO(4) have been recognized as very promising electrodes for lithium-ion batteries because of their energy storage capacity combined with electrochemical and thermal stability. A key issue in these materials is to unravel the factors governing electron and ion transport within the lattice. Lithium extraction from LiFePO(4) results in a two-phase mixture with FePO(4) that limits the power characteristics owing to the low mobility of the phase boundary. This boundary is a consequence of low solubility of the parent phases, and its mobility is impeded by slow migration of the charge carriers. In principle, these limitations could be diminished in a solid solution, Li(x)FePO(4). Here, we show that electron delocalization in the solid solution phases formed at elevated temperature is due to rapid small polaron hopping and is unrelated to consideration of the band gap. We give the first experimental evidence for a strong correlation between electron and lithium delocalization events that suggests they are coupled. Furthermore, the exquisite frequency sensitivity of M\"ossbauer measurements provides direct insight into the electron hopping rate.},

The sodium-ion battery field presents many solid state materials design challenges, and rising to that call in the past couple of years, several reports of new sodium-ion technologies and electrode materials have surfaced. These range from high-temperature air electrodes to new layered oxides, polyanion-based materials, carbons and other insertion materials for sodium-ion batteries, many of which hold promise for future sodium-based energy storage applications.

In particular, it is shown explicitly that the time-dependent activationlike energy arising in the previously developed theory of correlated small-polaron hopping motion is directly related to the actual relaxation of the lattice from the distorted configuration it must assume to facilitate a small-polaron hop. That is, the time dependence of this "activation energy" and the concomitant relaxation of the hop-related lattice displacements are governed by a single entity denoted as the relaxation function. Furthermore it is demonstrated that this function is directly expressible in terms of the transfer of vibrational energy from the initially distorted sites to successive (initially undistorted) neighbor sites. In fact, for the most part, the relaxation of the lattice after a hop is associated with the transfer of vibrational energy to only nearest-neighbor sites, this being essentially a local phenomenon independent of the periodic nature of the lattice. Finally, although the lattice relaxation for our three-dimensional model is found to proceed much faster than in the previously developed one-dimensional model, its effect on small-polaron hopping motion may not be inconsequential. In particular, the small-polaron drift mobility is shown to be significantly affected by lattice relaxation effects when the mean time between small-polaron hops is less than or comparable to the lattice relaxation time; this time being essentially the reciprocal of the optical-phonon bandwidth parameter.},

However, the application to large spatial databases rises the following requirements for clustering algorithms: minimal requirements of domain knowledge to determine the input parameters, discovery of clusters with arbitrary shape and good efficiency on large databases. The well-known clustering algorithms offer no solution to the combination of these requirements. In this paper, we present the new clustering algorithm DBSCAN relying on a density-based notion of clusters which is designed to discover clusters of arbitrary shape. DBSCAN requires only one input parameter and supports the user in determining an appropriate value for it. We performed an experimental evaluation of the effectiveness and efficiency of DBSCAN using synthetic data and real data of the SEQUOIA 2000 benchmark. The results of our experiments demonstrate that (1) DBSCAN is significantly more effective in discovering clusters of arbitrary shape than the well-known algorithm CLARANS, and that (2) DBSCAN outperforms CLARANS by a factor of more than 100 in terms of efficiency.},

We have developed a machine learning model to calculate density functional theory quality formation energies of all the 2 M pristine ABC\$\_2\$D\$\_6\$ elpasolite crystals which can be made up from main-group elements (up to bismuth). Our model's accuracy can be improved systematically, reaching 0.1 eV/atom for a training set consisting of 10 k crystals. Important bonding trends are revealed, fluoride is best suited to fit the coordination of the D site which lowers the formation energy whereas the opposite is found for carbon. The bonding contribution of elements A and B is very small on average. Low formation energies result from A and B being late elements from group (II), C being a late (I) element, and D being fluoride. Out of 2 M crystals, the three degenerate pairs CaSrCs\$\_2\$F\$\_6\$/SrCaCs\$\_2\$F\$\_6\$, CaSrRb\$\_2\$F\$\_6\$/SrCaRb\$\_2\$F\$\_6\$ and CaBaCs\$\_2\$F\$\_6\$/BaCaCs\$\_2\$F\$\_6\$ yield the lowest formation energies: \$-3.44\$, \$-3.41\$, and \$-3.39\$ eV/atom, respectively.

  abstract = {We investigate the impact of choosing regressors and molecular representations for the construction of fast machine learning (ML) models of 13 electronic ground-state properties of organic molecules. The performance of each regressor/representation/property combination is assessed using learning curves which report out-of-sample errors as a function of training set size with up to {$\sim$}118k distinct molecules. Molecular structures and properties at the hybrid density functional theory (DFT) level of theory come from the QM9 database [Ramakrishnan et al. Sci. Data 2014, 1, 140022] and include enthalpies and free energies of atomization, HOMO/LUMO energies and gap, dipole moment, polarizability, zero point vibrational energy, heat capacity, and the highest fundamental vibrational frequency. Various molecular representations have been studied (Coulomb matrix, bag of bonds, BAML and ECFP4, molecular graphs (MG)), as well as newly developed distribution based variants including histograms of distances (HD), angles (HDA/MARAD), and dihedrals (HDAD). Regressors include linear models (Bayesian ridge regression (BR) and linear regression with elastic net regularization (EN)), random forest (RF), kernel ridge regression (KRR), and two types of neural networks, graph convolutions (GC) and gated graph networks (GG). Out-of sample errors are strongly dependent on the choice of representation and regressor and molecular property. Electronic properties are typically best accounted for by MG and GC, while energetic properties are better described by HDAD and KRR. The specific combinations with the lowest out-of-sample errors in the {$\sim$}118k training set size limit are (free) energies and enthalpies of atomization (HDAD/KRR), HOMO/LUMO eigenvalue and gap (MG/GC), dipole moment (MG/GC), static polarizability (MG/GG), zero point vibrational energy (HDAD/KRR), heat capacity at room temperature (HDAD/KRR), and highest fundamental vibrational frequency (BAML/RF). We present numerical evidence that ML model predictions deviate from DFT (B3LYP) less than DFT (B3LYP) deviates from experiment for all properties. Furthermore, out-of-sample prediction errors with respect to hybrid DFT reference are on par with, or close to, chemical accuracy. The results suggest that ML models could be more accurate than hybrid DFT if explicitly electron correlated quantum (or experimental) data were available.}

Here we introduce a rotationally non-invariant local structure representation that enables different predictions for different loading orientations, which is found essential for high-fidelity prediction of the propensity for stress-driven shear transformations. This novel structure representation, when combined with convolutional neural network (CNN), a powerful deep learning algorithm, leads to unprecedented accuracy for identifying atoms with high propensity for shear transformations (i.e., plastic susceptibility), solely from the static structure in both two- and three-dimensional model glasses. The data-driven models trained on samples at one composition and a given processing history are found transferrable to glass samples with different processing histories or at different compositions in the same alloy system. Our analysis of the new structure representation also provides valuable insight into key atomic packing features that influence the local mechanical response and its anisotropy in glasses.},

The dehydration proceeds through three distinct steps: an initial topotactic structural condensation, which is endothermic, followed by an exothermic nucleation and growth step that results in the formation of aTiOz (B)-like intermediate, and a final, low-energy transformation, which yields TiO, (B). The structures of D2Ti307 and TiO, (B) have been refined from powder neutron diffraction data in order to better understand the relationship between the initial titanate structures and the formation of TiOz (B).},

LTO electrodes of the same primary crystal structure but of different grain boundary structures were prepared and they showed significantly different electrochemical performance. LTO electrodes with a percolated 3D structural network and bridged grain boundaries offered balanced 8a-16c occupancy, Li ion exchange at 8a and 16c sites upon discharge, high ionic conductivities, and good rate performance. While LTO electrodes with isolated clusters of particles showed strong rate dependence of 8a-16c occupancy, a lack of Li ion exchange at 8a and 16c sites, large over-potential, and substantial capacity decay upon fast charging. Bridged grain boundaries in LTO secondary particles facilitate apparent solid-solution process during electrochemical cycling by maintaining Li site exchange and thus enhance the rate performance of LTO electrodes.},

We demonstrate phase stability in the multicomponent alloy system of Cr-Mo-Nb-V, for which some of its binary subsystems are subject to phase separation and complex intermetallic-phase formation. Our first-principles calculation of free energy predicts that the configurational entropy stabilizes a single body-centered cubic (BCC) phase from T = 1,700K up to melting, while precipitation of a complex intermetallic is favored at lower temperatures. We form the compound experimentally and confirm that it forms as a single BCC phase from the melt, but that it transforms reversibly at lower temperatures.},

  abstract = {All-solid-state rechargeable sodium (Na)-ion batteries are promising for inexpensive and high-energy-density large-scale energy storage. In this contribution, new Na solid electrolytes, Na3-yPS4-xClx, are synthesized with a strategic approach, which allows maximum substitution of Cl for S (x = 0.2) without significant compromise of structural integrity or Na deficiency. A maximum conductivity of 1.96 mS cm-1 at 25\textdegree C is achieved for Na3.0PS3.8Cl0.2 , which is two orders of magnitude higher compared with that of tetragonal Na3PS4 (t-Na3PS4). The activation energy (Ea) is determined to be 0.19 eV. Ab initio molecular dynamics simulations shed light on the merit of maximizing Cldoping while maintaining low Na deficiency in enhanced Na-ion conduction. Solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) characterizations confirm the successful substitution of Cl for S and the resulting change of P oxidation state from 5+ to 4+, which is also verified by spin moment analysis. Ion transport pathways are determined with a tracer-exchange NMR method. The functional detects that promote Na -ion transport are maximized for further improvement in ionic conductivity. Full-cell performance is demonstrated using Na/Na3.0PS3.8Cl0.2/Na3V2(PO4)3 with a reversible capacity of {$\approx$}100 mAh g-1 at room temperature.},

  abstract = {The safety concern is the main obstacle that hinders the large-scale applications of lithium ion batteries in electric vehicles. With continuous improvement of lithium ion batteries in energy density, enhancing their safety is becoming increasingly urgent for the electric vehicle development. Thermal runaway is the key scientific problem in battery safety research. Therefore, this paper provides a comprehensive review on the thermal runaway mechanism of the commercial lithium ion battery for electric vehicles. Learning from typical accidents, the abuse conditions that may lead to thermal runaway have been summarized. The abuse conditions include mechanical abuse, electrical abuse, and thermal abuse. Internal short circuit is the most common feature for all the abuse conditions. The thermal runaway follows a mechanism of chain reactions, during which the decomposition reaction of the battery component materials occurs one after another. A novel energy release diagram, which can quantify the reaction kinetics for all the battery component materials, is proposed to interpret the mechanisms of the chain reactions during thermal runaway. The relationship between the internal short circuit and the thermal runaway is further clarified using the energy release diagram with two cases. Finally, a three-level protection concept is proposed to help reduce the thermal runaway hazard. The three-level protection can be fulfilled by providing passive defense and early warning before the occurrence of thermal runaway, by enhancing the intrinsic thermal stability of the materials, and by reducing the secondary hazard like thermal runaway propagation.},

The diffusion map is a nonlinear dimensionality reduction technique with the capacity to systematically extract the essential dynamical modes of high-dimensional simulation trajectories, furnishing a kinetically meaningful low-dimensional framework with which to develop insight and understanding of the underlying dynamics and thermodynamics. We survey the potential of this approach in the field of molecular simulation, consider its challenges, and discuss its underlying concepts and means of application.

  abstract = {In silico design of new molecules and materials with desirable quantum properties by high-throughput screening is a major challenge due to the high dimensionality of chemical space. To facilitate its navigation, we present a unification of coordinate and composition space in terms of alchemical normal modes (ANMs) which result from second order perturbation theory. ANMs assume a predominantly smooth nature of chemical space and form a basis in which new compounds can be expanded and identified. We showcase the use of ANMs for the energetics of the iso-electronic series of diatomics with 14 electrons, BN doped benzene derivatives (C\$\_\{6-2x\}\$(BN)\$\_\{x\}\$H\$\_6\$ with \$x = 0, 1, 2, 3\$), predictions for over 1.8 million BN doped coronene derivatives, and genetic energy optimizations in the entire BN doped coronene space. Using Ge lattice scans as reference, the applicability ANMs across the periodic table is demonstrated for III-V and IV-IV-semiconductors Si, Sn, SiGe, SnGe, SiSn, as well as AlP, AlAs, AlSb, GaP, GaAs, GaSb, InP, InAs, and InSb. Analysis of our results indicates simple qualitative structure property rules for estimating energetic rankings among isomers. Useful quantitative estimates can also be obtained when few atoms are changed to neighboring or lower lying elements in the periodic table. The quality of the predictions often increases with the symmetry of system chosen as reference due to cancellation of odd order terms. Rooted in perturbation theory the ANM approach promises to generally enable unbiased compound exploration campaigns at reduced computational cost.},

In this article we introduce the Representational State Transfer (REST) architectural style, developed as an abstract model of the Web architecture and used to guide our redesign and definition of the Hypertext Transfer Protocol and Uniform Resource Identifiers. We describe the software engineering principles guiding REST and the interaction constraints chosen to retain those principles, contrasting them to the constraints of other architectural styles. We then compare the abstract model to the currently deployed Web architecture in order to elicit mismatches between the existing protocols and the applications they are intended to support.},

In practice, this means that ceramic-sulfide batteries require a suitable coating material to isolate the electrolyte from the electrode materials. In this work, the interfacial stability of Li10SiP2S12 with over 67 000 materials is computationally evaluated. Over 2000 materials that are predicted to form stable interfaces in the cathode voltage range and over 1000 materials for the anode range are reported on and cataloged. LiCoO2 is chosen as an example cathode material to identify coating compounds that are stable with both Li10SiP2S12 and a common cathode. The correlation between elemental composition and multiple instability metrics (e.g., chemical/electrochemical) is analyzed, revealing key trends in, amongst others, the role of anion selection. A new binary-search algorithm is introduced for evaluating the pseudo-phase with improved speed and accuracy. Computational challenges posed by high-throughput interfacial phase-diagram calculations are highlighted as well as pragmatic computational methods to make such calculations routinely feasible. In addition to the over 3000 materials cataloged, representative materials from the anionic classes of oxides, fluorides, and sulfides are chosen to experimentally demonstrate chemical stability when in contact with Li10SiP2S12.},

The effect of tin substitution on structure and lithium-ion conductivity was studied with powder X-ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy, and dielectric spectroscopy. It is found that, although increased unit-cell dimensions derived from X-ray data suggest that tin incorporation should open the conduction bottleneck regions and improve conductivity, a decrease in conductivity is observed. Analysis of the electrical data shows that the conduction activation energy is comprised of contributions from carrier motion and generation, the latter accounting for up to 20\% of the total activation energy. This result, currently unreported for NASICON-type materials, is correlated with local structural distortions observed in Raman spectra. It is deduced that the bottleneck regions suffer distortions due to the large ionic radius disparity among cationic constituents, which results in the ``trapping'' of charge carriers. Data estimated for the entropy of motion are also presented and discussed, considering the most probable thermodynamic equilibrium states.}

This rock-salt-type nanostructured material shows a discharge capacity of 355 mAh g-1, which is the highest yet reported among the known lithium manganese oxide electrode materials.

  abstract = {The one-dimensional molecular crystal model of polaron motion, developed in parts I and II, is suitably generalized to consider the existence of a Hall effect. As in II, the treatment is confined to the case for which the electronic-overlap term of the total Hamiltonian is a small perturbation. In zeroth order\textemdash i.e., in the absence of this term\textemdash the electron is localized at a given site. The vibrational state of the system is specified by a set of quantum numbers, Nk, giving the degree of excitation of each vibrational mode. The existence of a nonvanishing electronic bandwidth then gives rise to transitions to neighboring sites. Of principal interest in the present paper is the high temperature regime (T \textbackslash textgreater Tt, as defined in II) where polaron motion is predominantly by means of random jumps between neighboring sites. Although the lowest order jump rate is adequate in considering the polaron drift mobility, higher order processes, involving the occupation of (at least) three sites, must be taken into account in treating the Hall effect. In particular, it is demonstrated the relative probability of the electron, initially located on one of the three sites, hopping to one or the other of the remaining two sites, is modified by a contribution which, both in sign and magnitude, is linearly proportional to the applied magnetic field. This effect is shown to arise from the interference between the amplitude for the direct transition from the initial to the final site, and the amplitude for an indirect, second order transition, involving intermediate occupancy of the third site. The (magnetic) field induced components of the jump rates, corresponding to the above processes, are first calculated by a classical occurrence-probability approach which treats the lattice vibrational coordinates as given functions of time. The second approach presents a full quantum mechanical calculation of the jump rates. The results of this treatment agree with those of the occurrence-probability approach in the classical limit (T {$\Theta$}De bye). The order of magnitude of the calculated Hall Coefficients are found to be greater than or comparable to the ``normal'' result (R = -1/nec) depending on whether or not the three sites involved in the transition are mutually nearest neighbors. A final note corrects an error in a previous paper by one of the authors (T. H.) concerning the sign of the Hall effect in impurity conduction.},

PBI was identified as a supramolecular redox mediator for soluble lithium polysulfides from a library of 85 polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons by using a high-throughput computational platform; furthermore, these theoretical predictions were validated electrochemically. Challenging conventional wisdom, we found that {$\pi$}-stacked PBI assemblies were stable even in their reduced state through secondary interactions between PBI nanofibers and Li2Sn, which resulted in a redox-active, flowable 3-D gel network. The influence of supramolecular charge-transporting PBI-PS gel networks on Li-S battery performance was investigated in depth and revealed enhanced sulfur utilization and rate performance (C/4 and C/8) at a sulfur loading of 4 mg cm-2 and energy density of 44 Wh L-1 in the absence of conductive carbon additives.}

Among all solid electrolyte materials ranging from sulfides to oxides and oxynitrides, cubic garnet\textendash type Li 7 La 3 Zr 2 O 12 (LLZO) ceramic electrolytes are superior candidates because of their high ionic conductivity (10 -3 to 10 -4 S/cm) and good stability against Li metal. However, garnet solid electrolytes generally have poor contact with Li metal, which causes high resistance and uneven current distribution at the interface. To address this challenge, we demonstrate a strategy to engineer the garnet solid electrolyte and the Li metal interface by forming an intermediary Li-metal alloy, which changes the wettability of the garnet surface (lithi-ophobic to lithiophilic) and reduces the interface resistance by more than an order of magnitude: 950 ohm{$\cdot$}cm 2 for the pristine garnet/Li and 75 ohm{$\cdot$}cm 2 for the surface-engineered garnet/Li. Li 7 La 2.75 Ca 0.25 Zr 1.75 Nb 0.25 O 12 (LLCZN) was selected as the solid-state electrolyte (SSE) in this work because of its low sintering temperature, stabilized cubic garnet phase, and high ionic conductivity. This low area-specific resistance enables a solid-state garnet SSE/Li metal configuration and promotes the development of a hybrid electrolyte system. The hybrid system uses the improved solid-state garnet SSE Li metal anode and a thin liquid electrolyte cathode interfacial layer. This work provides new ways to address the garnet SSE wetting issue against Li and get more stable cell performances based on the hybrid electrolyte system for Li-ion, Li-sulfur, and Li-oxygen batteries toward the next generation of Li metal batteries.},

  abstract = {The literature on vibrational thermodynamics of materials is reviewed. The emphasis is on metals and alloys, especially on the progress over the last decade in understanding differences in the vibrational entropy of different alloy phases and phase transformations. Some results on carbides, nitrides, oxides, hydrides and lithium-storage materials are also covered. Principles of harmonic phonons in alloys are organized into thermodynamic models for unmixing and ordering transformations on an Ising lattice, and extended for non-harmonic potentials. Owing to the high accuracy required for the phonon frequencies, quantitative predictions of vibrational entropy with analytical models prove elusive. Accurate tools for such calculations or measurements were challenging for many years, but are more accessible today. Ab initio methods for calculating phonons in solids are summarized. The experimental techniques of calorimetry, inelastic neutron scattering, and inelastic X-ray scattering are explained with enough detail to show the issues of using these methods for investigations of vibrational thermodynamics. The explanations extend to methods of data analysis that affect the accuracy of thermodynamic information. It is sometimes possible to identify the structural and chemical origins of the differences in vibrational entropy of materials, and the number of these assessments is growing. There has been considerable progress in our understanding of the vibrational entropy of mixing in solid solutions, compound formation from pure elements, chemical unmixing of alloys, order\textendash disorder transformations, and martensitic transformations. Systematic trends are available for some of these phase transformations, although more examples are needed, and many results are less reliable at high temperatures. Nanostructures in materials can alter sufficiently the vibrational dynamics to affect thermodynamic stability. Internal stresses in polycrystals of anisotropic materials also contribute to the heat capacity. Lanthanides and actinides show a complex interplay of vibrational, electronic, and magnetic entropy, even at low temperatures. A ``quasiharmonic model'' is often used to extend the systematics of harmonic phonons to high temperatures by accounting for the effects of thermal expansion against a bulk modulus. Non-harmonic effects beyond the quasiharmonic approximation originate from the interactions of thermally-excited phonons with other phonons, or with the interactions of phonons with electronic excitations. In the classical high temperature limit, the adiabatic electron\textendash phonon coupling can have a surprisingly large effect in metals when temperature causes significant changes in the electron density near the Fermi level. There are useful similarities in how temperature, pressure, and composition alter the conduction electron screening and the interatomic force constants. Phonon\textendash phonon ``anharmonic'' interactions arise from those non-harmonic parts of the interatomic potential that cannot be accounted for by the quasiharmonic model. Anharmonic shifts in phonon frequency with temperature can be substantial, but trends are not well understood. Anharmonic phonon damping does show systematic trends, however, at least for fcc metals. Trends of vibrational entropy are often justified with atomic properties such as atomic size, electronegativity, electron-to-atom ratio, and mass. Since vibrational entropy originates at the level of electrons in solids, such rules of thumb prove no better than similar rules devised for trends in bonding and structure, and tend to be worse. Fortunately, the required tools for accurate experimental investigations of vibrational entropy have improved dramatically over the past few years, and the required ab initio methods have become more accessible. Steady progress is expected for understanding the phenomena reviewed here, as investigations are performed with the new tools of experiment and theory, sometimes in integrated ways.},

It is shown that the reversible capacity is almost independent of electrode mass at currents lower than ca. 1 C (170 mAh g(-1)). At higher currents, however, the reversible capacity starts to drop significantly. The electrode resistance determined from the corresponding polarization voltage shows inverse proportionality with mass at currents smaller than 1 C. At higher currents the electrode resistance is almost independent of electrode mass. We conclude that at lower currents (below 1 C) the main transport step is related to the active particles themselves (either to incorporation reaction or solid state diffusion of Li).

The configuration of all dislocations indicates that they are glissile, and dislocation configurations were found that are indicative of active slip planes. Perfect dislocations of a/3\^112\textasciimacron{} 0\& type Burgers vectors were observed on \$0001\% habit planes. These perfect dislocations sometimes dissociate into Shockley partial dislocations with a/3\^101\textasciimacron{} 0\& type Burgers vectors. Glide of these partial dislocations can account for the sequence of crystal structures O3, H1-3, O1 that occur with the delithiation of LiCoO2 . The presence of glissile dislocations also suggests possible damage mechanisms during cycling.},

While a number of studies have reported different Li2O2 morphologies formed during discharge, the influence of the morphology and structure of Li2O2 on the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) kinetics and pathways is not known. Here, we show that two characteristic Li2O2 morphologies are formed in carbon nanotube (CNT) electrodes in a 1,2- dimethoxyethane (DME) electrolyte: discs / toroids (50 - 200 nm) at low rates / overpotentials (10 mA/gC or E \textbackslash textgreater 2.7 V vs. Li), or small particles (\textbackslash textless 20 nm) at higher rates / overpotentials. Upon galvanostatic charging, small particles exhibit a sloping profile with low 15 overpotential (\textbackslash textless 4 V) while discs exhibit a two-stage process involving an initially sloping region followed by a voltage plateau. Potentiostatic intermittent titration technique (PITT) measurements reveal that charging in the sloping region corresponds to solid solution-like delithiation, whereas the voltage plateau (E = 3.4 V vs. Li) corresponds to two-phase oxidation. The marked differences in charging profiles is attributed to differences in surface structure, as supported by X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) data showing that oxygen anions on disc surfaces have LiO2-like electronic features while those on the particle surfaces are more bulk Li2O2- 20 like with modified electronic structure compared to commercial Li2O2. Such an integrated structural, chemical, and morphological approach to understanding the OER kinetics provides new insights into the desirable discharge product structure for charging at lower overpotentials.}

The organo-metal perovskite shows very good potential to be used as a light harvester in the solar cell due to its direct band gap, large absorption coefficient, high carrier mobility and good stability. However, there is an important question in the photovoltaic field regarding the more advantageous architecture for perovskite based solar cells. Several studies showed sensitized perovskite solar cells achieving high performance, while high efficiency was also observed with planar architecture. Consequently, it is still an open questionable regarding which operation mechanism and which architecture offers better results. This review describes both architectures, based on studies in the field. In the case of sensitized structure, there are more difficulties in pore filling, naturally more recombination, and the possibility to use thicker metal oxide films. In the planar structure, thin metal oxide films are used, less recombination was observed and there are no infiltration problems. Both architectures exhibit long-range diffusion length and meet the demand for excellent coverage of the perovskite film.}

A judicious choice of the liquid electrolytes used in these systems is required to achieve a good balance among high-energy storage, long cycle life and stability, and fast charging. Ethylene-carbonate (EC) and propylene-carbonate (PC) are popular electrolytes. However, to date, almost all molecular-dynamics simulations of these fluids rely on classical force fields, while a complete description of the functionality of Li-ion batteries will eventually require quantum mechanics. We perform accurate ab initio molecular-dynamics simulations of ethylene- and propylene-carbonate with LiPF(6) at experimental concentrations to build solvation models which explain available neutron scattering and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) results and to compute Li-ion solvation energies and diffusion constants. Our results suggest some similarities between the two liquids as well as some important differences.

Despite numerous studies, the detailed crystal structure is still open to conjecture because of the difficulty of identifying precisely the positions of Li atoms and the distribution of intrinsic cation vacancies. Here we use subangstrom resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) imaging methods and spatially resolved electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) analysis to examine the local atomic structure of LLTO. Direct annular bright-field (ABF) observations show Li locations on O4 window positions in Li-poor phase La0.62Li0.16TiO3 and near to A-site positions in Li-rich phase La0.56Li0.33TiO3. Local clustering of A-site vacancies results in aggregation of Li atoms, enhanced octahedral tilting and distortion, formation of O vacancies, and partial Ti4+ reduction. The results suggest local LLTO structures depend on a balance between the distribution of A-site vacancies and the need to maintain interlayer charge neutrality. The associated local clustering of A-site vacancies and aggregation of Li atoms is expected to affect the Li-ion migration pathways, which change from two-dimensional in Li-poor LLTO to three-dimensional in Li-rich LLTO. This study demonstrates how a combination of advanced STEM and EELS analysis can provide critical insights into the atomic structure and crystal chemistry of solid ionic conductors.},

These hot spots are responsible for phenomena such as subwavelength focusing, surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy and electromagnetic transparency, and depend on the geometry of the nanojunctions between the metal surfaces. Direct-write techniques such as electron-beam lithography can create complex nanostructures with impressive spatial control but struggle to fabricate gaps on the order of a few nanometres or manufacture arrays of nanojunctions in a scalable manner. Self-assembly methods, in contrast, can be carried out on a massively parallel scale using metal nanoparticle building blocks of specific shape. Here, we show that polymer-grafted metal nanocubes can be self-assembled into arrays of one-dimensional strings that have well-defined interparticle orientations and tunable electromagnetic properties. The nanocubes are assembled within a polymer thin film and we observe unique superstructures derived from edge-edge or face-face interactions between the nanocubes. The assembly process is strongly dependent on parameters such as polymer chain length, rigidity or grafting density, and can be predicted by free energy calculations.},

The method is based on a predictive quantum-mechanical theory\textemdash e.g., density functional theory\textemdash and its accuracy can be systematically improved at a very modest computational cost. Our approach is based on dividing the electron density of the system into a reference part\textemdash typically corresponding to the system's neutral, geometry-dependent ground state\textemdash and a deformation part\textemdash defined as the difference between the actual and reference densities. We then take advantage of the fact that the bulk part of the system's energy depends on the reference density alone; this part can be efficiently and accurately described by a force field, thus avoiding explicit consideration of the electrons. Then, the effects associated to the difference density can be treated perturbatively with good precision by working in a suitably chosen Wannier function basis. Further, the electronic model can be restricted to the bands of interest. All these features combined yield a very flexible and computationally very efficient scheme. Here we present the basic formulation of this approach, as well as a practical strategy to compute model parameters for realistic materials. We illustrate the accuracy and scope of the proposed method with two case studies, namely, the relative stability of various spin arrangements in NiO (featuring complex magnetic interactions in a strongly-correlated oxide) and the formation of a two-dimensional electron gas at the interface between band insulators LaAlO3 and SrTiO3 (featuring subtle electron-lattice couplings and screening effects). We conclude by discussing ways to overcome the limitations of the present approach (most notably, the assumption of a fixed bonding topology), as well as its many envisioned possibilities and future extensions.},

As a consequence, the bond is elongated by almost 0.5 \textbackslash AA leading to an extreme Stokes shift of 2.6 eV. The strong vibronic coupling entails significant broadening of the excitonic absorption peak in good agreement with diffuse reflectance data on Li(2)O(2) which shows a rather featureless spectrum with an absorption onset around 3.0 eV.

Recent experiments indicate that the charge transport through these materials is the main limiting factor for the battery performance. It has been also shown that the performance of the battery decreases drastically when the amount of Li2CO3 at the cathode increases with respect to Li2O2. In this work, we study the formation and transport of hole and electron polarons in Li2O2 and Li2CO3 using density functional theory (DFT) within the PBE+U approximation. For both materials, we find that the formation of polarons (both hole and electron) is stabilized with respect to the delocalized states for all physically relevant values of U. We find a much higher mobility for hole polarons than for the electron polarons, and we show that the poor charge transport in Li2CO3 compared to Li2O2 can be understood through a polaronic model for the conduction. Furthermore, the hole polaronic model in Li2O2 provides a possible explanation for the experimentally observed preferential growth direction of the films. Our results also suggest that doping is unlikely to be a viable route for improving the transport properties of Li2O2 or Li2CO3.}

  abstract = {Materials built from MO6 octahedra linked to XO4 tetrahedra are good candidates for studying the different factors that determine the electrode potential. Among them, olivine-like LiMPO4 (M = transition metal) phosphates are especially interesting. When pressure is applied to LiMPO4 (M = Ni and Fe), a phase transition is induced. However, instead of the well-known olivine {$\Leftrightarrow$} spinel transformation, a transition to a new phase is observed ({$\beta$}`). The arrangements of the metal ions (including phosphorus) in the two structures are very similar; thus, the main difference between them is due to the oxygen arrangement in a similar matrix. Raman spectroscopy has confirmed the structural model proposed for the high-pressure phase, in particular the modification in the lithium coordination from 6- to 4-fold upon synthesis under pressure. Among the olivines LiMPO4 (M = Mn, Ni, and Fe), the iron-containing one is only active up to 5.1 V. On the other hand, none of the high-pressure materials is electrochemically active; this can be explained by the change in the electrostatic field at the transition metal position.}

Appropriate visualization of the data immediately allows certain insights to be gained with regard to the property space of plausible thermoelectric materials. Of particular note is that any candidate material needs to display an electrical resistivity value that is close to 1 m\$\O mega\$ cm at 300 K, that is, samples should be significantly more conductive than the Mott minimum metallic conductivity. The Herfindahl-Hirschman index, a commonly accepted measure of market concentration, has been calculated from geological data (known elemental reserves) and geopolitical data (elemental production) for much of the periodic table. The visualization strategy employed here allows rapid sorting of thermoelectric compositions with respect to important issues of elemental scarcity and supply risk.},

  abstract = {The co-operative Jahn-Teller effect is a phase transition which is driven by the interaction between localized orbital electronic states and the crystal lattice. It involves the simultaneous splitting of the electronic states and a symmetry-lowering distortion of the lattice. Recent advances in the understanding of this effect have been spectacular both because of the discovery of a family of transparent rare earth compounds in which it is easy to measure the changes of energy of the electronic states and because of the increasing use which has been made of ultrasonic techniques for investigating lattice distortions. It will be shown that in most materials the coupling is predominantly to a strain (which changes the shape of the crystal) and the ultrasonic method provides a direct observation of the softening of the appropriate elastic constant near the transition temperature. This strain mode coupling provides an effective interaction between the Jahn-Teller active ions which has a very long range. As a result molecular field theory can be used to provide a quantitative description of very many of the properties of these systems. The article discusses in detail the possible origins, symmetries and properties of the electron-lattice interactions and how they lead to possible hamiltonians for the coupled system. The relation of these interactions with quadrupolar interactions and with magnetostriction is included. The methods of solution of the hamiltonians which are discussed lead to an understanding of the electronic states, the phonon spectrum and the mixed normal modes. A very wide variety of experimental techniques has been brought to bear on this problem. These are reviewed in detail and the results are compared with theoretical expressions whenever possible. The application of external stress and magnetic field turns out to be of particular significance in the case of the rare earth compounds, because here they can produce effects which are larger than the low-temperature spontaneous effects.},

  abstract = {Molecular orbital calculations on a variety of silicate and aluminosilicate molecules have been used to explore the bonding forces that govern tetrahedral bond length variations, r(TO), in framework silicates and ahiminosilicates. Not only do the calculations provide insight into the variety of structural types and the substitution limits of one tetrahedral atom for another, but they also provide an understanding of the interrelationships among r(TO) and linkage factors, bond strength sum, coordination number, and angles within and between tetrahedra. A study of these interrelationships for a theoretical data set shows that r(SiO) and r(A10) are linearly correlated with (1) po, the bond strength sum to a bridging oxygen, (2)fs(O), the fractional s-character of a bridging oxygen, and (3)fs(T), the fractional s-character of the T atom. In a multiple linear regression analysis of the data, 92\% of the variation of r(SiO) and 99\% of the variation of r(A10) can be explained in terms of a linear dependence on Po, fs(O), and fs(T). Analogous regression analyses completed for observed r(A1, SiO) bond length data from a number of silica polymorphs and ordered aluminosilicates account for more than 75\% of the bond length variation. The lower percentage of bond length variation explained is ascribed in part to the random and systematic errors in the experimental data which have a negligible effect on the theoretical data. The modeling of more than 75\% of the variation of r(A1, SiO) in the framework silicates using the same model used for silicate and aluminosilicate molecules strengthens the viewpoint that the bonding forces that govern the shapes of such molecules are quite similar to the forces that govern the shapes of chemically similar groups in solids. The different regression coefficients calculated for fs(T) indicate that SiO and A10 bond length variations in framework structures should not be treated as a single population in estimating the average A1, Si content of a tetrahedral site.},

In particular, long-wavelength phonons are considerably more damped in glasses, yet it remains unclear how structural disorder at atomic scales affects such a macroscopic phenomenon. A plausible explanation is that phonons are scattered by local elastic heterogeneities that are essentially uncorrelated in space, a scenario known as Rayleigh scattering, which predicts that the damping of acoustic phonons scales with wavenumber k as kd+1 (in dimension d). Here we demonstrate that phonon damping scales instead as -kd+1 ln k, with this logarithmic enhancement originating from long- range spatial correlations of elastic disorder caused by similar stress correlations. Our work suggests that the presence of long-range spatial correlations of local stress and elasticity may well be the crucial feature that distinguishes amorphous solids from crystals.}

  abstract = {Metal-insulator transition (MIT) compounds are materials that may exhibit metallic or insulating behavior, depending on the physical conditions, and are of immense fundamental interest owing to their potential applications in emerging microelectronics. An important subset of MIT materials are those with a transition driven by temperature. The number of thermally driven MIT materials, however, is scarce, which makes delineating these compounds from those that are exclusively insulating or metallic challenging. Most research that addresses thermal MITs is limited by the domain knowledge of the scientists to a subset of MIT materials and is often focused on a limited subset of possible features. Here, using a combination of domain knowledge and natural language processing (NLP) searches, we have built a material database comprising thermally driven MITs as well as metals and insulators with similar chemical composition and stoichiometries to the MIT compounds. We featurized this data set using a wide variety of compositional, structural, and energetic descriptors, including two MIT relevant energy scales, the estimated Hubbard interaction and the charge transfer energy, as well as the structurebond-stress metric referred to as the global-instability index (GII). We then performed supervised classification on this data set, constructing three electronic-state classifiers: metal vs nonmetal (M), insulator vs noninsulator (I), and MIT vs non-MIT (T). This classification allows us to identify new features separating MIT materials from non-MIT materials. These include the 2D feature space consisting of the average deviation of the covalent radius, the range of the Mendeleev number and Ewald energy. We discuss the relationship of these atomic features to the physical interactions underlying MITs in the rare-earth nickelate family. We then elaborate on other features (GII and Ewald energy) and examine how they affect the classification of binary vanadium and titanium oxides. Last, we implement an online and publicly accessible version of the classifiers, enabling quick probabilistic class predictions by uploading a crystallographic structure file. The broad accessibility of our database, newly identified features, and user-friendly classifier models will aid in accelerating the discovery of MIT materials.},

  abstract = {An alternative reaction-rate approach is suggested for dealing with the relaxation times of dipolar defects in alkali halides. It rests on an occurrence-probability definition of the transition rate, accounting for both classical and quantal effects. A simple model Hamiltonian is postulated to describe the reorientational motion of a dipole within the framework of the adiabatic approximation. Two infamous examples are considered from this point of view. In one of these, the OH- dipole is assumed to couple only electronically to the neighboring cations, while all its remaining reorientational characteristics are, to a first approximation, independent of the host lattice. Assuming further that a single local oscillator drives the reorientational motion, this model agrees well with the experimental temperature dependence of the OH- relaxation time in four host halides up to 10 K, as measured by Kapphan and L\"uty. The other example is the off-center Ag+ ion in RbBr and RbCl where a formal application of the reaction-rate method has been found to fit closely, over the entire range, the experimental temperature dependence of the relaxation time for 90\textdegree{} reorientation, measured by the same authors.},

Luckily, several promising and closely related neural network models invariant to molecular symmetries have already been described in the literature. These models learn a message passing algorithm and aggregation procedure to compute a function of their entire input graph. At this point, the next step is to find a particularly effective variant of this general approach and apply it to chemical prediction benchmarks until we either solve them or reach the limits of the approach. In this paper, we reformulate existing models into a single common framework we call Message Passing Neural Networks (MPNNs) and explore additional novel variations within this framework. Using MPNNs we demonstrate state of the art results on an important molecular property prediction benchmark; these results are strong enough that we believe future work should focus on datasets with larger molecules or more accurate ground truth labels.},

Sodium fluoroperovskites of Fe, Mn, and Ni were achieved by mechanical grinding of NaF and binary metal fluorides for different periods of time under Ar. The obtained monophases were characterized by XRD measurements, AAS, ICP-OES, and IC. The electrochemical performance of the achieved materials was tested in a Na halfcell under different operating conditions. It was revealed that mechanochemically inserted sodium is electrochemically active for the NaFeF3 positive electrode composition.

Our study focuses on the performance of the carbon negative electrode, which is composed of TIMREX SFG synthetic graphite material of varying particle size distribution. All cells showed high discharge and comparatively low charge rate capability. Up to the 20 C rate, discharge capacity retention of more than 96\% was found for SFG6. The rate capability of the half-cells is a function of both the particle size distribution of the graphite material and the preparation method of the electrode. A transport limitation model is proposed to explain the restrictions of the high current performance of graphite electrodes. The key parameters found to influence the performance of a graphite negative electrode were the loading, the thickness, and the porosity of the electrode. (C) 2005 The Electrochemical Society.

  abstract = {The rise and fall of artificial neural networks is well documented in the scientific literature of both computer science and computational chemistry. Yet almost two decades later, we are now seeing a resurgence of interest in deep learning, a machine learning algorithm based on multilayer neural networks. Within the last few years, we have seen the transformative impact of deep learning in many domains, particularly in speech recognition and computer vision, to the extent that the majority of expert practitioners in those field are now regularly eschewing prior established models in favor of deep learning models. In this review, we provide an introductory overview into the theory of deep neural networks and their unique properties that distinguish them from traditional machine learning algorithms used in cheminformatics. By providing an overview of the variety of emerging applications of deep neural networks, we highlight its ubiquity and broad applicability to a wide range of challenges in the field, including QSAR, virtual screening, protein structure prediction, quantum chemistry, materials design and property prediction. In reviewing the performance of deep neural networks, we observed a consistent outperformance against non-neural networks state-of-the-art models across disparate research topics, and deep neural network based models often exceeded the "glass ceiling" expectations of their respective tasks. Coupled with the maturity of GPU-accelerated computing for training deep neural networks and the exponential growth of chemical data on which to train these networks on, we anticipate that deep learning algorithms will be a valuable tool for computational chemistry.},

As the number of so far unexplored alloy systems is large, the chances that such magnet materials still exist are good. The successful search for novel hard magnetic phases demands an efficient approach of restricting and prioritizing the search field as well as deployment of efficient synthesis and analysis methods. The high-throughput approaches are based on heterogeneous nonequilibrium states and the estimation of the intrinsic material parameters from the domain structure. The efficiency of the methods is demonstrated for the well-known systems Co-Sm and Fe-Nd-B. The methods are then applied to discover novel hard magnetic compounds with RE elements of better availability (Fe-Nd-(Ce,La,Y)-B) or smaller amount (Fe-Ce-(Ti,Zr)).},

The demand for novel hard magnetic phases with more widely available RE metals, reduced RE content or, even better, completely free of RE metals is therefore tremendous. The chances are that such materials still exist given the large number of as yet unexplored alloy systems. To discover such phases, an elaborate concept is necessary which can restrict and prioritize the search field while making use of efficient synthesis and analysis methods. It is shown that an efficient synthesis of new phases using heterogeneous non-equilibrium diffusion couples and reaction sintering is possible. Quantitative microstructure analysis of the domain pattern of the hard magnetic phases can be used to estimate the intrinsic magnetic parameters (saturation polarization from the domain contrast, anisotropy constant from the domain width, Curie temperature from the temperature dependence of the domain contrast). The probability of detecting TM-rich phases for a given system is high, therefore the approach enables one to scan through even higher component systems with one single sample. The visualization of newly occurring hard magnetic phases via their typical domain structure and the correlation existing between domain structure and intrinsic magnetic properties allows an evaluation of the industrial relevance of these novel phases.},

  abstract = {Virtual screening is becoming a ground-breaking tool for molecular discovery due to the exponential growth of available computer time and constant improvement of simulation and machine learning techniques. We report an integrated organic functional material design process that incorporates theoretical insight, quantum chemistry, cheminformatics, machine learning, industrial expertise, organic synthesis, molecular characterization, device fabrication and optoelectronic testing. After exploring a search space of 1.6 million molecules and screening over 400,000 of them using time-dependent density functional theory, we identified thousands of promising novel organic light-emitting diode molecules across the visible spectrum. Our team collaboratively selected the best candidates from this set. The experimentally determined external quantum eeciencies for these synthesized candidates were as large as 22\%. T he availability of unprecedented computational resources and novel algorithms is opening pathways to solve problems that were previously intractable due to their large scale. For this reason, computational tools can become a disruptive instrument for molecular discovery. Chemical space is infinite for practical purposes 1 , but many important and desirable properties of materials are predictable from simulation. However, computers alone cannot meet this challenge, no matter how powerful. It is only with experimental guidance and collaboration that a computer-driven approach becomes a natural fit for this task. High-throughput virtual screening (HTVS) combines quantum chemical calculations and cheminformatics methods to search molecular space for leads 2\textendash 4 . Advised by computational predictions, experimental efforts are focused on only the most promising molecular candidates. Recent applications of this approach include screening for both inorganic 5,6 and organic materials in application areas such as electrolytes for flow batteries 7,8 and photovoltaics 9\textendash 11 . However, it is not often that HTVS predictions are confirmed experimentally, due to factors such as access to experimental partners, synthetic difficulty, poor predictive power, and instability of candidate molecules. The emissive layers of organic light-emitting diode (OLED) devices are made from electroluminescent molecules. Because of their high efficiency and superior colour properties, OLEDs have wide application in small displays and the OLED technology has the potential to become an attractive solution for larger displays such as televisions, flexible displays, or lighting applications. Traditional fluorescent emitters rely on the quantum-mechanically allowed singlet\textendash singlet transition, and therefore can harvest only one quarter of the electron\textendash hole recombination pairs formed in the device. Current phosphorescent OLED technology leverages spin\textendash orbit coupling due to heavy atoms 12 , most often iridium. This makes the triplet state emissive, and also harvests the singlet excitons through these emissive triplets 13 . However, iridium is one of the least abundant elements, and thus phosphorescent OLEDs face high materials cost. Additionally, OLEDs face challenges in efficiency and stability. In particular, deep-blue emitters magnify these problems due to the large amount of energy stored in the excited state, around 3 eV. The promises and challenges of OLED technology and materials have sparked significant research interest, as detailed in recent reviews 14,15 . One particularly promising approach to circumvent the high cost of phosphorescent OLED materials is thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) 16\textendash 18 . In TADF, non-emissive triplet states are harvested via thermal fluctuations that repopulate the emissive singlet state through a process known as reverse intersystem}

With these strategies, it is difficult to meet the commercial constraints on Li-ion batteries for plug-in-hybrid and all-electric vehicles as well as those for stationary electrical energy storage (EES) in a grid. Existing alternative strategies include a gaseous O2 electrode in a Li/air battery and a solid sulfur (S8) cathode in a Li/S battery. We compare the projected energy densities and EES efficiencies of these cells with those of a third alternative, a Li/Fe(III)/Fe(II) cell containing a redox couple in an aqueous solution as the cathode. Preliminary measurements indicate proof of concept, but implementation of this strategy requires identification of a suitable Li+-ion electrolyte.},

Cooperative local deformations that are static give rise, below a transition temperature Tt, to a lowering of the lattice symmetry, anisotropic interactions, and the possibility of a ferromagnetism that is oriented in opposition to a magnetic field applied on cooling through the transition. Dynamic local deformations can influence the physical properties of a solid in a variety of ways. Of special interest is the influence of dynamic deformations at a cross-over from localized to itinerant electronic behavior in a mixed-valent system. INTRODUCTION},

Unfortunately, the NPLs suffer from poor color stability and insufficient colloidal stability. However, the improvement in their stability has not been extensively studied. In this study, the blue emission of CsPbBr3 NPLs is stabilized by B-site doping approach, wherein a few of Pb2+ octahedral sites are replaced with small-sized Cu2+ ions. Cu2+-doped NPLs exhibit greater longterm stability in ambient conditions and better photostability compared to their undoped counterparts. First-principles calculations reveal that the Jahn\textendash Teller distortion of (CuBr6)4- octahedra results in the shorter Pb-Br bonds and contraction of the entire CsPbBr3 lattice, which in turn increases the band gap of the CsPbBr3 NPLs. Cu2+ dopants also reduce the surface energy of the NPLs and impart highly desirable long-term stability. Therefore, the outcomes of this work might be a step forward towards improving the stability of two-dimensional perovskite NPLs.},

A descriptor-based approach to estimate the ORR activity of binary surface alloys, wherein alloying occurs only in the surface layer, is described, and rigorous, potential-dependent computational tests of the stability of these alloys in aqueous, acidic environments are presented. These activity and stability criteria are applied to a database of DFT calculations on nearly 750 binary transition metal surface alloys; of these, many are predicted to be active for the ORR but, with few exceptions, they are found to be thermodynamically unstable in the acidic environments typical of low-temperature fuel cells. The results suggest that, absent other thermodynamic or kinetic mechanisms to stabilize the alloys, surface alloys are unlikely to serve as useful ORR catalysts over extended periods of operation.}

  abstract = {Useful properties of structural materials generally depend on their bulk microstructure. For centuries, improvements in structural materials relied heavily on processing, which in turn determined the resulting microstructure and properties. Materials sciences are entering an era in which specific properties of a material are obtained not only from its processing but also by controlling of the architecture of its constituents, often with sub-micron dimensions. To utilize this newly achievable nanoscale engineering precision in structural applications, it is imperative to quantify the deformation processes at each relevant scale, with special attention focusing on the importance of internal and external heterogeneities, for example grain boundaries, bi-material interfaces, phase boundaries, etc., on mechanical loading. It has been shown for single crystals that yield (and fracture) strengths increase with power-law dependence on sample size reduction when the micron scale is reached, and therefore, can no longer be inferred from bulk response or from the literature. Although these studies provide a powerful foundation for fundamental deformation processes operating at small scales, they are far from representing real materials used in structural applications, whose microstructure is often complex, containing boundaries and interfaces. Both homogeneous (i.e. grain and twin boundaries) and heterogeneous (i.e. phase and precipitate\textendash matrix boundaries) interfaces in size-limited features are crucial aspects of the structural reliability of most modern materials. They are also of particular importance to damage initiation. This article provides a comprehensive overview of the state-of-the-art experimental and computational methods used to investigate mechanical behavior and microstructural evolution in small-scale metallic systems, deformation of which depends on intricate interactions of defects with internal interfaces and with free surfaces. Attention is focused on the effects of multiple grain boundaries spanning the sample volume (nanocrystalline and polycrystalline metals). This overview sheds light on the relative importance of intrinsic versus extrinsic length scale limitations on deformation mechanisms in nanostructured metals, which has significant implications for the development of new materials with tunable mechanical properties.},

  abstract = {Nanostructuring and nanosizing have been widely employed to increase the rate capability in a variety of energy storage materials. While nanoprocessing is required for many materials, we show here that both the capacity and rate performance of low-temperature bronze-phase TT- and Tpolymorphs of Nb2O5 are inherent properties of the bulk crystal structure. Their unique ``room-and-pillar'' NbO6/NbO7 framework structure provides a stable host for lithium intercalation; bond valence sum mapping exposes the degenerate diffusion pathways in the sites (rooms) surrounding the oxygen pillars of this complex structure. Electrochemical analysis of thick films of micrometer-sized, insulating niobia particles indicates that the capacity of the T-phase, measured over a fixed potential window, is limited only by the Ohmic drop up to at least 60C (12.1 A{$\cdot$}g-1), while the higher temperature (Wadsley-Roth, crystallographic shear structure) H-phase shows high intercalation capacity ({$>$}200 mA{$\cdot$}h{$\cdot$}g-1) but only at moderate rates. High-resolution 6/7Li solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy of T-Nb2O5 revealed two distinct spin reservoirs, a small initial rigid population and a majority-component mobile distribution of lithium. Variabletemperature NMR showed lithium dynamics for the majority lithium characterized by very low activation energies of 58(2)- 98(1) meV. The fast rate, high density, good gravimetric capacity, excellent capacity retention, and safety features of bulk, insulating Nb2O5 synthesized in a single step at relatively low temperatures suggest that this material not only is structurally and electronically exceptional but merits consideration for a range of further applications. In addition, the realization of high rate performance without nanostructuring in a complex insulating oxide expands the field for battery material exploration beyond conventional strategies and structural motifs.},

  abstract = {The maximum power output and minimum charging time of a lithium-ion battery depend on both ionic and electronic transport. Ionic diffusion within the electrochemically active particles generally represents a fundamental limitation to the rate at which a battery can be charged and discharged. To compensate for the relatively slow solid-state ionic diffusion and to enable high power and rapid charging, the active particles are frequently reduced to nanometre dimensions, to the detriment of volumetric packing density, cost, stability and sustainability. As an alternative to nanoscaling, here we show that two complex niobium tungsten oxides\textemdash Nb16W5O55 and Nb18W16O93, which adopt crystallographic shear and bronze-like structures, respectively\textemdash can intercalate large quantities of lithium at high rates, even when the sizes of the niobium tungsten oxide particles are of the order of micrometres. Measurements of lithium-ion diffusion coefficients in both structures reveal room-temperature values that are several orders of magnitude higher than those in typical electrode materials such as Li4Ti5O12 and LiMn2O4. Multielectron redox, buffered volume expansion, topologically frustrated niobium/tungsten polyhedral arrangements and rapid solid-state lithium transport lead to extremely high volumetric capacities and rate performance. Unconventional materials and mechanisms that enable lithiation of micrometre-sized particles in minutes have implications for high-power applications, fast-charging devices, all-solid-state energy storage systems, electrode design and material discovery.},

  abstract = {Ferroelectrics have recently attracted attention as a candidate class of materials for use in photovoltaic devices, and for the coupling of light absorption with other functional properties. In these materials, the strong inversion symmetry breaking that is due to spontaneous electric polarization promotes the desirable separation of photo-excited carriers and allows voltages higher than the bandgap, which may enable efficiencies beyond the maximum possible in a conventional p-n junction solar cell. Ferroelectric oxides are also stable in a wide range of mechanical, chemical and thermal conditions and can be fabricated using low-cost methods such as sol-gel thin-film deposition and sputtering. Recent work has shown how a decrease in ferroelectric layer thickness and judicious engineering of domain structures and ferroelectric-electrode interfaces can greatly increase the current harvested from ferroelectric absorber materials, increasing the power conversion efficiency from about 10(-4) to about 0.5 per cent. Further improvements in photovoltaic efficiency have been inhibited by the wide bandgaps (2.7-4 electronvolts) of ferroelectric oxides, which allow the use of only 8-20 per cent of the solar spectrum. Here we describe a family of single-phase solid oxide solutions made from low-cost and non-toxic elements using conventional solid-state methods: [KNbO3]1 - x[BaNi1/2Nb1/2O3 - {$\delta$}]x (KBNNO). These oxides exhibit both ferroelectricity and a wide variation of direct bandgaps in the range 1.1-3.8 electronvolts. In particular, the x = 0.1 composition is polar at room temperature, has a direct bandgap of 1.39 electronvolts and has a photocurrent density approximately 50 times larger than that of the classic ferroelectric (Pb,La)(Zr,Ti)O3 material. The ability of KBNNO to absorb three to six times more solar energy than the current ferroelectric materials suggests a route to viable ferroelectric semiconductor-based cells for solar energy conversion and other applications.},

  abstract = {Layered oxides are the subject of intense studies either for their properties as electrode materials for high-energy batteries or for their original physical properties due to the strong electronic correlations resulting from their unique structure. Here we present the detailed phase diagram of the layered P2-NaxVO2 system determined from electrochemical intercalation/deintercalation in sodium batteries and in situ X-ray diffraction experiments. It shows that four main single-phase domains exist within the 0:5x0:9 range. During the sodium deintercalation (intercalation), they differ from one another in the sodium/vacancy ordering between the VO2 slabs, which leads to commensurable or incommensurable superstructures. The electrochemical curve reveals that three peculiar compositions exhibit special structures for xD1=2, 5/8 and 2/3. The detailed structural characterization of the P2-Na1=2VO2 phase shows that the NaC ions are perfectly ordered to minimize NaC/NaC electrostatic repulsions.Within the VO2 layers, the vanadium ions form pseudo-trimers with very short V\textendash V distances (two at 2.581\textbackslash AA and one at 2.687\textbackslash AA). This original distribution leads to a peculiar magnetic behaviour with a low magnetic susceptibility and an unexpected low Curie constant. This phase also presents a first-order structural transition above room temperature accompanied by magnetic and electronic transitions. This work opens up a new research domain in the field of strongly electron-correlated materials. From the electrochemical point of view this system may be at the origin of an entire material family optimized by cationic substitutions.},

Comparison of the unsubstituted parent compound with the substituted compounds shows that bipyridine substitution doesn't alter significantly the photophysical properties of the lanthanide cryptate. The absorption maximum is slightly red-shifted when three bipyridines are substituted, whereas substituting one bipyridines has a negligible effect on the absorption spectra. The experimental triplet state energy is between 21600 and 22 100 cm(-1) for the series of compounds and the luminescence lifetimes at 77 K are between 0.5 and 0.8 ms in HO2 and equal to 1.7 ms in D2O. The experimental characterizations are completed by DFT and TD-DFT calculations to assess the ability of these approaches to predict absorption maxima, triplet state energies and structural parameters of lanthanide cryptates and to characterize the electronic structure of the excited states. The calculations on the unsubstituted parent and substituted compounds show that absorption maxima and lowest 3pipi* triplet state energies can be accurately determined from density functional theory (DFT) and time-dependent (TD) DFT calculations.},

The present study, based on a confrontation between experiment and theory, aims at providing new knowledge regarding the ionic conductivity model of such systems in correlation with its structure. The computational strategy involved molecular dynamic simulations and first-principle calculations on molecular and periodic models. The experimental target data involve electronic and vibrational properties and were considered through the simulation of Raman and X-ray photoemission spectra in order to identify characteristic patterns of LixPOyNz. In particular, the presence of short phosphate chains is suggested by molecular dynamics calculations, and the simulation of Raman spectra clearly evidenced a new coordination for nitrogen atoms in the amorphous state, not considered until now in the experimental structural model of the electrolyte and initially hypothesized based on core level binding energy computations. Monovalent nitrogen atoms together with short phosphate chains were used to build a structural model of the electrolyte and appeared to lead to a better reproduction of the target experimental results, while it implies a necessary refinement of the diffusion schemes commonly considered for lithium ions.},

EuSn2P2 has a layered, Bi2Te3-type structure. Ferromagnetic interactions dominate the Curie-Weiss susceptibility, but a transition to antiferromagnetic ordering occurs near 30 K. Neutron diffraction reveals that this is due to two-dimensional ferromagnetic spin alignment within individual Eu layers and antiferromagnetic alignment between layersthis magnetic state surrounds the Sn-P layers at low temperatures. The bulk electrical resistivity is sensitive to the magnetism. Electronic structure calculations reveal that EuSn2P2 might be a strong topological insulator, which can be a new magnetic topological quantum material (MTQM) candidate. The calculations show that surface states should be present, and they are indeed observed by angle-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy (ARPES) measurements.},

Herein, we presents a comprehensive study of intercalation chemistry of the DRX-Li3V2O5 anode using density functional theory calculations combined with machine learning cluster expansions and interatomic potentials. The predicted voltage profile of the disordered Li3V2O5 anode at room temperature based on Monte Carlo simulations with a fitted cluster expansion model is in excellent agreement with experiments. In contrast to previous DFT results, we find that Li ions predominately intercalate into tetrahedral sites during charging, while the majority of Li and V ions at octahedral sites remain stable. In addition, MD simulations with a fitted moment tensor potential attribute the fast-charging capability of DRX-Li3V2O5 to the facile diffusivity of Li+ via tetrahedral - octahedral - tetrahedral pathway. We further suggest tuning the Li:V ratio as a means to trade off increased lithiation capacity and decreased anode voltage in this system. This work provides in-depth insights into the high-performance DRX-Li3V2O5 anode, and paves the way to the discovery of other disordered anode materials.},

Using a grand potential phase diagram construction, we show that water and Na co-intercalation result in fundamentally different phase transition behavior and, hence, electrochemical voltage profiles in wet versus dry electrolytes. Lattice water increases the average voltage and reduces the volume change during electrochemical cycling, resulting in both higher energy density and better cycling stability. Finally, we identified four new PBA compositions, Na2CoMn(CN)6, Na2NiMn(CN)6, Na2CuMn(CN)6, and Na2ZnMn(CN)6, that show great promise as cathodes for aqueous rechargeable Na-ion batteries.},

The PBE functional [J. P. Perdew et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 77, 3865 (1996)], the most common of them, provides excellent results in many cases. However, very recently other GGA functionals have been proposed and compete in accuracy with the PBE functional, in particular for the structure of solids. We have tested these GGA functionals, as well as the local-density approximation (LDA) and TPSS (meta-GGA approximation) functionals, on a large set of solids using an accurate implementation of the Kohn-Sham equations, namely, the full-potential linearized augmented plane-wave and local orbitals method. Often these recently proposed GGA functionals lead to improvement over LDA and PBE, but unfortunately none of them can be considered as good for all investigated solids.},

  abstract = {This Perspective introduces the Harvard Clean Energy Project (CEP), a theory-driven search for the next generation of organic solar cell materials. We give a broad overview of its setup and infrastructure, present first results, and outline upcoming developments. CEP has established an automated, high-throughput, in silico framework to study potential candidate structures for organic photovoltaics. The current project phase is concerned with the characterization of millions of molecular motifs using first-principles quantum chemistry. The scale of this study requires a correspondingly large computational resource, which is provided by distributed volunteer computing on IBM's World Community Grid. The results are compiled and analyzed in a reference database and will be made available for public use. In addition to finding specific candidates with certain properties, it is the goal of CEP to illuminate and understand the structureproperty relations in the domain of organic electronics. Such insights can open the door to a rational and systematic design of future highperformance materials. The computational work in CEP is tightly embedded in a collaboration with experimentalists, who provide valuable input and feedback to the project.},

For the singly activated compositions, the highest quantum efficiencies were 25\% and 40\% for Sr1.998Eu0.002LiAlO4 and Sr1.998Ce0.002LiAlO4 respectively. The emission of Sr2LiAlO4:Ce3+ and the excitation of Sr2LiAlO4:Eu2+ overlap in the range of 400 nm - 500 nm so that energy transfer from Ce3+ \textrightarrow{} Eu2+ takes place. The emission color of Eu2+ and Ce3+ co-activated Sr2LiAlO4 changes from blue, to cool-white, to green depending on the activators concentrations. The maximum quantum efficiency of Eu2+ and Ce3+ co-activated Sr2LiAlO4 was 55\% when the concentrations of Eu2+ and Ce3+ were 0.005 and 0.001, respectively, which demonstrates that the corresponding quantum efficiency improves by co-activating with Eu2+ and Ce3+.},

The interactions between atoms and electrons are governed by the laws of quantum mechanics; hence, accurate and efficient techniques for solving the basic quantum-mechanical equations for complex many-atom, many-electron systems must be developed. Density functional theory (DFT) marks a decisive breakthrough in these efforts, and in the past decade DFT has had a rapidly growing impact not only on fundamental but also industrial research. This article discusses the fundamental principles of DFT and the highly efficient computational tools that have been developed for its application to complex problems in materials science. Also highlighted are state-ofthe-art applications in many areas of materials research, such as structural materials, catalysis and surface science, nanomaterials, and biomaterials and geophysics.},

  abstract = {The compound CsH2PO4 has emerged as a viable electrolyte for intermediate temperature (200\textendash 300 1C) fuel cells. In order to settle the question of the high temperature behavior of this material, conductivity measurements were performed by two-point AC impedance spectroscopy under humidified conditions (p[H2O] = 0.4 atm). A transition to a stable, high conductivity phase was observed at 230 1C, with the conductivity rising to a value of 2.2 102 S cm1 at 240 1C and the activation energy of proton transport dropping to 0.42 eV. In the absence of active humidification, dehydration of CsH2PO4 does indeed occur, but, in contradiction to some suggestions in the literature, the dehydration process is not responsible for the high conductivity at this temperature. Electrochemical characterization by galvanostatic current interrupt (GCI) methods and three-point AC impedance spectroscopy (under uniform, humidified gases) of CsH2PO4 based fuel cells, in which a composite mixture of the electrolyte, Pt supported on carbon, Pt black and carbon black served as the electrodes, showed that the overpotential for hydrogen electrooxidation was virtually immeasurable. The overpotential for oxygen electroreduction, however, was found to be on the order of 100 mV at 100 mA cm2. Thus, for fuel cells in which the supported electrolyte membrane was only 25 mm in thickness and in which a peak power density of 415 mW cm2 was achieved, the majority of the overpotential was found to be due to the slow rate of oxygen electrocatalysis. While the much faster kinetics at the anode over those at the cathode are not surprising, the result indicates that enhancing power output beyond the present levels will require improving cathode properties rather than further lowering the electrolyte thickness. In addition to the characterization of the transport and electrochemical properties of CsH2PO4, a discussion of the entropy of the superprotonic transition and the implications for proton transport is presented.},

We identified Eu2+- activated Ca7Mg(SiO4)4 and CaMg(SiO3)2 as having a relatively high {$\Theta$} = 601 K and 665 K, respectively, and predicted excitation energies of 3.18 eV (337 nm) and 3.29 eV (377 nm), respectively, both of which are in good agreement with the results of photoluminescence spectroscopy. However, the measured {$\Phi$} for these two phosphors was \textbackslash textless 30\%, which indicates that {$\Theta$} alone is not a sufficient condition for a high {$\Phi$}. This work demonstrates the potential of combined first-principles calculations and experiments in the discovery and design of novel near-UV excited phosphors.},

In this study we explore the possibility of building a library of NN-based models by introducing a hierarchical NN training. In such a stratified procedure NNs for multicomponent systems are obtained by sequential training from the bottom up: first unaries, then binaries, and so on. Advantages of constructing NN sets with shared parameters include acceleration of the training process and intact description of the constituent systems. We use an automated generation of diverse structure sets for NN training on density functional theory-level reference energies. In the test case of Cu, Pd, Ag, Cu-Pd, Cu-Ag, Pd-Ag, and Cu-Pd-Ag systems, NNs trained in the traditional and stratified fashions are found to have essentially identical accuracy for defect energies, phonon dispersions, formation energies, etc. The models' robustness is further illustrated via unconstrained evolutionary structure searches in which the NN is used for the local optimization of crystal unit cells.},

To improve their electrochemical performances, we investigated the electrochemical reactions of the SEs and their structural changes. The detailed changes in the structure and electronic states have not yet been measured experimentally because of the difficulty in observing the microscopic area formed at the interface between the electrode materials and the SEs. Thus, we prepared composite electrodes composed of Li 3 PS 4 SE and carbon to increase the electrochemical reaction area. The structural and electronic-state changes in Li 3 PS 4 during the Li deinsertion-insertion processes were revealed using X-ray diffraction and Raman, X-ray photoelectron, and X-ray absorption spectroscopies. We found that the sulfide ions in Li 3 PS 4 contribute to charge compensation during the charge-discharge processes. The S-S bonds between PS 4 units associate and dissociate via the retention of the covalent bonds between the P atoms and S-S bonds. Although the anion redox behavior is generally discussed with regard to transition metal chalcogenides, here we first report the reversible association and dissociation of S-S bonds in typical element compounds. This knowledge contributes to an improved understanding of the anion redox reactions and the interfacial resistances between high-voltage positive electrodes and SEs.},

The [beta]-phase belongs to the large family of stuffed tridymites, with the P and Co atoms occupying tetrahedral sites and the Na atoms located in the cavities of the tetrahedral framework. The long c axis corresponds to a 3 x superstructure of the basic tridymite framework (c [asymptotically equal to] 8 A) and is caused by the displacement of the Na atoms, tetrahedral tilts and strong distortions of the CoO4 tetrahedra. A bond-valence analysis of these phases reveals that the polymorphism in NaCoPO4 is due in part to over-/underbonding of the Na atom in the low-/high-temperature structures, respectively.},

This is partly due to the occupation of vanadium sites by Zr4+ ions in the Li3V2(PO4)3 host crystals and facile Li ion migration through a LiZr2(PO4)3-like secondary phase that forms on the surface of the Li3V1.95Zr0.05(PO4)3 particles.

Here, we used broadband impedance spectroscopy and               7               Li NMR relaxation measurements and show that very fast local Li ion exchange processes are taking place in all three compounds.

One accessible pathway for achieving green emission is by forming a solid solution with superior blue-emitting materials. In this work, we demonstrate that the cyan-emission ({$\lambda$}em = 481 nm) of the BaScO2F:Eu2+ perovskite can be red-shifted by forming a solid solution following (Ba1-xSrx)0.98Eu0.02ScO2F (x = 0, 0.075, 0.15, 0.25, 0.33, 0.40). Although green emission is achieved ({$\lambda$}em = 516 nm) as desired, the thermal quenching (TQ) resistance is reduced, and the photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) drops by 65\%. Computation reveals the source of these changes. Surprisingly, a basic density functional theory analysis shows the gradual SrBa substitution has negligible effects on the band gap (Eg) energy, suggesting the activation energy barrier for the thermal ionization quenching remains unchanged, while the nearly constant Debye temperature indicates no loss of average structural rigidity to explain the decrease in the PLQY. Instead, temperature-dependent ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations show that gradual changes of the Eu2+ ion's local coordination environment rigidity are responsible for the drop in the observed TQ and PLQY. These results express the need to computationally analyze the local rare-earth environment as a function of temperature to understand the fundamental origin of optical properties in new inorganic phosphors.},

But this approach is limited where large cells or searches over millions of structure types become necessary. To treat these with first-principles accuracy, one 'coarse-grains' the many-particle Schrodinger equation into 'model hamiltonians' whose variables are configurational order parameters (atomic positions, spin and so on), connected by a few 'interaction parameters' obtained from a microscopic theory. But to construct a truly quantitative model hamiltonian, one must know just which types of interaction parameters to use, from possibly 10(6)-10(8) alternative selections. Here we show how genetic algorithms, mimicking biological evolution ('survival of the fittest'), can be used to distil reliable model hamiltonian parameters from a database of first-principles calculations. We demonstrate this for a classic dilemma in solid-state physics, structural inorganic chemistry and metallurgy: how to predict the stable crystal structure of a compound given only its composition. The selection of leading parameters based on a genetic algorithm is general and easily applied to construct any other type of complex model hamiltonian from direct quantum-mechanical results.},

The algorithm is very efficient; the run time scales linearly with the number of unique structures found. We demonstrate the algorithm in the important case of hcp-derived superstructures. In the list of enumerated hexagonal-close-packed derivative superstructures, we predict several as-yet-unobserved structures as likely candidates for new intermetallic prototypes.},

  abstract = {We present an algorithm for generating derivative superstructures for large unit cells at a fixed concentration. The algorithm is useful when partial crystallographic information of an ordered phase is known. This work builds on the previous work of Hart and Forcade [Phys. Rev. B 77 224115, 2008; Phys. Rev. B 80 014120, 2009]. This extension of the original algorithm provides amapping from atomic configurations to consecutive integers when only a subset (fixed concentration) of all possible configurations is under consideration. As in the earlier algorithm, this mapping results in a minimal hash table and perfect hash function that enables an efficient method for enumerating the configurations of large unit cells; the run time scales linearly with the number of symmetrically-distinct configurations. We demonstrate the algorithm for a proposed structure in the Ag\textendash Pt system comprising 32 atoms, with stoichiometry 15:17, a configuration space of !400,000.},

Different from lithium-oxygen cells, where lithium peroxide is found as the discharge product, sodium superoxide (NaO2) is formed in the present cell, with overpotentials as low as 100 mV during charging. Several analytical methods are used to follow the cell reaction during discharge and charge. Changes in structure and morphology are studied by SEM and XRD. It is found that NaO2 grows as cubic particles with feed sizes in the range of 10-50 {$\mu$}m; upon recharge the particles consecutively decompose. Pressure monitoring during galvanostatic cycling shows that the coulombic efficiency (e(-)/O2) for discharge and charge is approx. 1.0, the expected value for NaO2 formation. Also optical spectroscopy is identified as a convenient and useful tool to follow the discharge-charge process. The maximum discharge capacity is found to be limited by oxygen transport within the electrolyte soaked carbon fiber cathode and pore blocking near the oxygen interface is observed. Finally electrolyte decomposition and sodium dendrite growth are identified as possible reasons for the limited capacity retention of the cell. The occurrence of undesired side reactions is analyzed by DEMS measurements during cycling as well as by post mortem XPS investigations.},

In this work, we present a comparison between reaction energies provided by experiments and computed by DFT in the generalized gradient approximation (GGA), using a Hubbard U parameter for some transitionmetal elements (GGA+U).We use a data set of 135 reactions involving the formation of ternary oxides from binary oxides in a broad range of chemistries and crystal structures. We find that the computational errors can be modeled by a normal distribution with a mean close to zero and a standard deviation of 24 meV/atom. The significantly smaller error compared to the more commonly reported errors in the formation energies from the elements is related to the larger cancellation of errors in energies when reactions involve chemically similar compounds. This result is of importance for phase diagram computations for which the relevant reaction energies are often not from the elements but from chemically close phases (e.g., ternary oxides versus binary oxides). In addition, we discuss the distribution of computational errors among chemistries and show that the use of a Hubbard U parameter is critical to the accuracy of reaction energies involving transition metals even when no major change in formal oxidation state is occurring.},

The traditional role of computation in materials design has been to better understand existing materials. However, an emerging paradigm for accelerated materials discovery is to design new compounds in silico using firstprinciples calculations, and then perform experiments on the computationally designed candidates. In this paper, we provide a review of ab initio computational materials design, focusing on instances in which a computational approach has been successfully applied to propose new materials of technological interest in the laboratory. Our examples include applications in renewable energy, electronic, magnetic and multiferroic materials, and catalysis, demonstrating that computationally guided materials design is a broadly applicable technique. We then discuss some of the common features and limitations of successful theoretical predictions across fields, examining the different ways in which first-principles calculations can guide the final experimental result. Finally, we present a future outlook in which we expect that new models of computational search, such as high-throughput studies, will play a greater role in guiding materials advancements.},

  abstract = {Finding new polyanionic Li-ion battery cathodes with higher capacities than LiFePO4 is currently a major target of battery research. One approach towards this goal is to develop materials capable of exchanging more than one lithium per transition metal. However, constraints on operating voltage due to organic electrolyte stability as well as cathode structural stability have made this target difficult to reach. More specifically, it is very challenging to develop a phosphate-based cathode in which a single element provides +2 to +4 redox activity in a reasonable voltage window: either the +2/+3 couple is too low (e.g., V) or the +3/+4 couple is too high in voltage (e.g., Fe). This makes several appealing structural frameworks such as tavorites difficult to use as practical two-electron systems. Here, we propose a voltage design strategy based on the mixing of different transition metals in crystal structures known to be able to accommodate lithium in insertion and delithiation. By mixing a metal active on the +2/+3 couple (e.g., Fe) with an element active on the +3/+5 or +3/+6 couples (e.g., V or Mo), we show that high capacity multi-electron cathodes can be designed in an adequate voltage window. We illustrate our mixing strategy on LiMP2O7 pyrophosphates as well as LiMPO4(OH) and LiM(PO4)F tavorites, and we use density functional theory computations to evaluate the theoretical capacity, voltage profile and stability of the compounds proposed by our design rules. From this analysis, we identify several new compounds of potential interest as cathode materials.},

All-solid-state batteries with inorganic solid electrolytes and electrodes are promising power sources for a wide range of applications because of their safety, long-cycle lives and versatile geometries. Rechargeable sodium batteries are more suitable than lithium-ion batteries, because they use abundant and ubiquitous sodium sources. Solid electrolytes are critical for realizing all-solid-state sodium batteries. Here we show that stabilization of a high-temperature phase by crystallization from the glassy state dramatically enhances the Na(+) ion conductivity. An ambient temperature conductivity of over 10(-4) S cm(-1) was obtained in a glass-ceramic electrolyte, in which a cubic Na(3)PS(4) crystal with superionic conductivity was first realized. All-solid-state sodium batteries, with a powder-compressed Na(3)PS(4) electrolyte, functioned as a rechargeable battery at room temperature.},

We consider five generalized-gradient approximation (GGA) functionals (PBE, PBEsol, WC, AM05, and HTBS) as well as the local density approximation (LDA) functional. We investigate a wide variety of materials including a semiconductor (silicon), a metal (copper), and various insulators (SiO2 {$\alpha$}-quartz and stishovite, ZrSiO4 zircon, and MgO periclase). For the structural properties, we find that PBEsol and WC are the closest to the experiments and AM05 performs only slightly worse. All three functionals actually improve over LDA and PBE in contrast with HTBS, which is shown to fail dramatically for {$\alpha$}-quartz. For the vibrational and thermodynamical properties, LDA performs surprisingly very well. In the majority of the test cases, it outperforms PBE significantly and also the WC, PBEsol and AM05 functionals though by a smaller margin (and to the detriment of structural parameters). On the other hand, HTBS performs also poorly for vibrational quantities. For the dielectric properties, none of the functionals can be put forward. They all (i) fail to reproduce the electronic dielectric constant due to the well-known band gap problem and (ii) tend to overestimate the oscillator strengths (and hence the static dielectric constant).},

Rosenbluth biasing, distance biasing, and the use of a lattice are all used to speed up Monte Carlo calculation, enabling the efficient simulation of the polyelectrolyte layer. The molecular theory explicitly incorporates the chain conformations and the possibility of counterion condensation. Using both Monte Carlo simulation and theory, we examine the effect of grafting density, surface charge density, charge strength, and polymer chain length on the distribution of the polyelectrolyte monomers and counterions. For all grafting densities examined, a sharp decrease in brush height is observed in the strongly charged regime using both Monte Carlo simulation and theory. The decrease in layer thickness is due to counterion condensation within the layer. The height of the polymer layer increases slightly upon charging the grafting surface. The molecular theory describes the structure of the polyelectrolyte layer well in all the different regimes that we have studied.},

Principally, this is because DFT in the Kohn\textendash Sham (KS) formalism offers the appealing combination of relatively high accuracy and relatively low computational cost. Despite their great successes, traditional semilocal functionals fail to describe some important problems in solid state physics and materials science, the most conspicuous example being the notorious band gap problem. More sophisticated functionals providing greater accuracy without sacrificing computational efficiency are therefore needed. The Heyd\textendash Scuseria\textendash Ernzerhof (HSE) screened hybrid density functional [J. Heyd, G. E. Scuseria, and M. Ernzerhof, J. Chem. Phys. 118, 8207 (2003); J. Heyd and G. E. Scuseria, J. Chem. Phys. 121, 1187 (2004)] successfully addresses some of the chief problems which plague semilocal functionals by including only the important parts of exact nonlocal Hartree\textendash Fock-type exchange. This work discusses some of the concepts underlying HSE and provides illustrative examples highlighting the successes of HSE in numerous solid state applications.},

  abstract = {While hybrid functionals are largely responsible for the utility of modern Kohn-Sham density functional theory, they are not without their weaknesses. In the solid state, the slow decay of their nonlocal Hartree-Fock-type exchange makes hybrids computationally demanding and can introduce unphysical effects. Both problems can be remedied by a screened hybrid which uses exact exchange only at short-range. Many molecular properties, in contrast, benefit from the inclusion of long-range exact exchange. Recently, the authors reconciled these two seemingly contradictory requirements by introducing the HISS functional [J. Chem. Phys. 2007, 127, 221103], which uses exact exchange only in the middle range. In this paper, we expand upon our previous work, benchmarking the performance of the HISS functional for several simple properties and applying it to the dissociation of homonuclear diatomic cations and to the polarizability of linear H2 chains to determine the importance of middle-range exact exchange for these systems, which are expected to be sensitive to the asymptotic exchange potential.},

Bader, Atoms in Molecules: A Quantum Theory, Oxford University Press, New York, 1990], space is divided up into atomic regions where the dividing surfaces are at a minimum in the charge density, i.e. the gradient of the charge density is zero along the surface normal. Instead of explicitly finding and representing the dividing surfaces, which is a challenging task, our algorithm assigns each point on a regular (x,y,z) grid to one of the regions by following a steepest ascent path on the grid. The computational work required to analyze a given charge density grid is approximately 50 arithmetic operations per grid point. The work scales linearly with the number of grid points and is essentially independent of the number of atoms in the system. The algorithm is robust and insensitive to the topology of molecular bonding. In addition to two test problems involving a water molecule and NaCl crystal, the algorithm has been used to estimate the electrical activity of a cluster of boron atoms in a silicon crystal. The highly stable three-atom boron cluster, B 3 I is found to have a charge of \`A1.5 e, which suggests approximately 50\% reduction in electrical activity as compared with three substitutional boron atoms.},

We show how the kinks arise and present an improved way of estimating the local tangent which solves the problem. The task of finding an accurate energy and configuration for the saddle point is also discussed and examples given where a complementary method, the dimer method, is used to efficiently converge to the saddle point. Both methods only require the first derivative of the energy and can, therefore, easily be applied in plane wave based density-functional theory calculations. Examples are given from studies of the exchange diffusion mechanism in a Si crystal, Al addimer formation on the Al(100) surface, and dissociative adsorption of CH 4 on an Ir(111) surface.},

The focus is entirely on methods that only require the potential energy and its first derivative with respect to the atom coordinates. Such methods can be applied, for example, in plane wave based Density Functional Theory calculations, and the computational effort typically scales well with system size. When the final state of the transition is known, both the initial and final coordinates of the atoms can be used as boundary conditions in the search. Methods of this type include the Nudged Elastic Band, Ridge, Conjugate Peak Refinement, Drag method and the method of Dewar, Healy and Stewart. When only the initial state is known, the problem is more challenging and the search for the saddle point represents also a search for the optimal transition mechanism.

We present a clear evidence for changes in the dynamical behavior at the transition to Arrhenius and then to a super-Arrhenius behavior. A simple model is presented, based on the idea of competition between single-particle and cooperative dynamics. We argue that Arrhenius behavior can take place as long as there is enough free volume for the completion of a simple T 1 relaxation process. Once free volume is absent one needs a cooperative mechanism to ``collect'' enough free volume. We show that this model captures all the qualitative behavior observed in simulations throughout the considered temperature range.},

Furthermore, we elucidate that the low energy barriers of the concerted ionic diffusion are a result of unique mobile ion configurations and strong mobile ion interactions in super-ionic conductors. Our results provide a general framework and universal strategy to design solid materials with fast ionic diffusion.},

  abstract = {The provision of efficient electron and ion transport is a critical issue in an exciting new group of materials based on lithium metal phosphates that are important as cathodes for lithium-ion batteries. Much interest centres on olivine-type LiFePO(4), the most prominent member of this family. Whereas the one-dimensional lithium-ion mobility in this framework is high, the electronically insulating phosphate groups that benefit the voltage also isolate the redox centres within the lattice. The pristine compound is a very poor conductor (sigma approximately 10(-9) S cm(-1)), thus limiting its electrochemical response. One approach to overcome this is to include conductive phases, increasing its capacity to near-theoretical values. There have also been attempts to alter the inherent conductivity of the lattice by doping it with a supervalent ion. Compositions were reported to be black p-type semiconductors with conductivities of approximately 10(-2) S cm(-1) arising from minority Fe(3+) hole carriers. Our results for doped (and undoped) LiMPO(4) (M = Fe, Ni) show that a percolating nano-network of metal-rich phosphides are responsible for the enhanced conductivity. We believe our demonstration of non-carbonaceous-network grain-boundary conduction to be the first in these materials, and that it holds promise for other insulating phosphates.},

In each method, a set of images along an initial pathway between two local minima is relaxed to find a MEP. We compare the nudged elastic band (NEB), doubly nudged elastic band, string, and simplified string methods, each with a set of commonly used optimizers. Our results show that the NEB and string methods are essentially equivalent and the most efficient methods for finding MEPs when coupled with a suitable optimizer. The most efficient optimizer was found to be a form of the limited-memory Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno method in which the approximate inverse Hessian is constructed globally for all images along the path. The use of a climbing-image allows for finding the saddle point while representing the MEP with as few images as possible. If a highly accurate MEP is desired, it is found to be more efficient to descend from the saddle to the minima than to use a chain-of-states method with many images. Our results are based on a pairwise Morse potential to model rearrangements of a heptamer island on Pt(111), and plane-wave based density functional theory to model a rollover diffusion mechanism of a Pd tetramer on MgO(100) and dissociative adsorption and diffusion of oxygen on Au(111).},

  abstract = {The critical challenge for the user acceptance of electric vehicles is the simultaneous improvement of the driving range and fast charging capabilities, which are related to the energy and power density of the storage device. Lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) are currently the most promising candidate to push electric vehicles toward the mass market. However, they suffer from a tradeoff between energy and power density, forbidding arbitrary combinations of high storage capacity and fast charging capability. Herein, a simple electrochemical principle describing the intrinsic limits of LIBs is reported. It is deduced that the tradeoff between energy and power density originates from diffusion limitations in the electrolyte. The electrochemical approach of diffusion-limited current density is adapted to porous Li-ion insertion electrodes, resulting in the ``diffusion-limited C-rate'' (DLC). The theoretical considerations are in excellent agreement with experimentally observed rate limitations of a large number of electrodes with different active materials and varying design parameters. While the C-rate drawn from an LIB cannot be higher than the DLC without significant capacity decline, parameter variations that improve the DLC reduce the nominal specific capacity. This relationship makes the DLC a fundamental quantity revealing the most expedient optimization approaches and promising directions for future battery research and development.},

The screened HF exchange decay properties and screening efficiency are compared with traditional hybrid functional calculations on solids. The HSE functional is then assessed using 21 metallic, semiconducting, and insulating solids. The examined properties include lattice constants, bulk moduli, and band gaps. The results obtained with HSE exhibit significantly smaller errors than pure density functional theory (DFT) calculations. For structural properties, the errors produced by HSE are up to 50\% smaller than the errors of the local density approximation, PBE, and TPSS functionals used for comparison. When predicting band gaps of semiconductors, we found smaller errors with HSE, resulting in a mean absolute error of 0.2 eV (1.3 eV error for all pure DFT functionals). In addition, we present timing results which show the computational time requirements of HSE to be only a factor of 2-4 higher than pure DFT functionals. These results make HSE an attractive choice for calculations of all types of solids.},

  abstract = {A combination of interpolation methods and local saddle-point search algorithms is probably the most efficient way of finding transition states in chemical reactions. Interpolation methods such as the growing-string method and the nudged-elastic band are able to find an approximation to the minimum-energy pathway and thereby provide a good initial guess for a transition state and imaginary mode connecting both reactant and product states. Since interpolation methods employ usually just a small number of configurations and converge slowly close to the minimum-energy pathway, local methods such as partitioned rational function optimization methods using either exact or approximate Hessians or minimum-mode-following methods such as the dimer or the Lanczos method have to be used to converge to the transition state. A modification to the original dimer method proposed by [Henkelman and Jonnson J. Chem. Phys. 111, 7010 (1999)] is presented, reducing the number of gradient calculations per cycle from six to four gradients or three gradients and one energy, and significantly improves the overall performance of the algorithm on quantum-chemical potential-energy surfaces, where forces are subject to numerical noise. A comparison is made between the dimer methods and the well-established partitioned rational function optimization methods for finding transition states after the use of interpolation methods. Results for 24 different small- to medium-sized chemical reactions covering a wide range of structural types demonstrate that the improved dimer method is an efficient alternative saddle-point search algorithm on medium-sized to large systems and is often even able to find transition states when partitioned rational function optimization methods fail to converge.},

An extensive analysis of both basis set and relativistic effects is given. Results are compared with established pure density functionals. For lattice constants, HSE outperforms local spin-density approximation (LSDA) with a mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.037 A for HSE vs 0.047 A for LSDA. For this specific test set, all pure functionals tested produce MAEs for band gaps of 1.0-1.3 eV, consistent with the very well-known fact that pure functionals severely underestimate this property. On the other hand, HSE yields a MAE smaller than 0.3 eV. Importantly, HSE correctly predicts semiconducting behavior in systems where pure functionals erroneously predict a metal, such as, for instance, Ge. The short-range nature of the exchange integrals involved in HSE calculations makes their computation notably faster than regular hybrid functionals. The current results, paired with earlier work, suggest that HSE is a fast and accurate alternative to established density functionals, especially for solid state calculations.},

However, LiVOPO4 exhibits polymorphism, forming either the {$\alpha$} I , {$\beta$}, or {$\epsilon$} phase. A thorough comparison between the properties of these phases is difficult because they usually differ in synthesis methods. In this study, we synthesize all three polymorphs by annealing a single precursor, LiVOPO4.2H2O, thereby reducing the effect of synthesis on the properties of the materials. We show through in-situ XRD with heating and DFT calculations that, in terms of stability, {$\alpha$} I -LiVOPO4 \textbackslash textless {$\epsilon$}-LiVOPO4 {$\leq$} {$\beta$}-LiVOPO4 . We also show experimentally and through DFT calculations that the tolerance to Ointerstitials and O-vacancies can explain the differences in stability, morphology, and electrochemical performance between {$\beta$}- and {$\epsilon$}-LiVOPO4 . {$\beta$}-LiVOPO4 is more stable in the presence of O-interstitials while {$\epsilon$}-LiVOPO4 is favored in the presence of O-vacancies. These defects affect the surface energies and morphology of the products formed, which are confirmed in the Wulff shape calculations and Transmission Electron Microscopy images. These imply that {$\beta$}-LiVOPO4 has an improved rate performance under an oxidizing atmosphere due to the increased presence of facets with superior ion diffusion at the surface. This improved performance is seen by the improved rate capability and capacity of {$\beta$}-LiVOPO4 in the high-voltage region. In contrast, synthesis conditions have little effect on improving the rate performance of {$\epsilon$}-LiVOPO4 .},

The long wavelength cut off for the solid is usually determined by a lattice or lattice type absorption of the constituent elements. These two wavelength limits are qualitatively predictable from the position of the constituent elements in the Periodic Table; that is{$\sim$} their atomic masses and electronic con- figurations. Absorption within the transmission range is usually related to impurities or the perfection of the sample and is thus related to the method of preparation. Materials in present use can be organized into four groups for comparison: alkali and alkaline earth halides{$\sim$} crystalline samiconductors; hot pressed II-VI compounds3 and the chalcogenide glasses. The distinc- tion between classes to some extent is related to methods of fabrication as well as chemical composition. Comparison of the physical properties considered important for optical applications shows that each family or group of materials has its own set of disadvantages.

  abstract = {The kinetic anisotropy of lithium ion adsorption and lithium absorption for LixFePO4 olivine nanocrystals is simulated and reported. The kinetics depend on the orientation of the electrolyte/LixFePO4 interface with respect to the far-field ionic fl ux. As a consequence of these kinetics and a Li miscibility gap in LixFePO4, the particle geometry and orientation also have an effect on the morphology of the two-phase evolution. These processes accompany the charge and discharge behavior in battery microstructures and a direct infl uence on battery behavior is suggested. A kinetic Monte Carlo (KMC) algorithm based on a cathode particle rigid lattice is used to simulate the kinetics in this system. In these simulations the adsorption kinetics of the electrolyte/electrode interface are treated by coupling the normal fl ux outside the particle from a continuum numerical simulation of Li-ion diffusion in the electrolyte to the atomistic KMC model within the particle. The interfacial reaction depends on local concentration and the potential drop at the interface via the Butler\textendash Volmer (B\textendash V) relation. The atomic potentials for the KMC simulation are derived from empirical solubility limits (as determined by OCV measurements). The main results show that the galvanostatic lithium-uptake/cellvoltage has three regimes: 1) a decreasing cell potential for Li-insertion into a Li-poor phase; 2) a nearly constant potential after the nucleation of a Li-rich phase Li(1-{$\beta$} )FePO4; 3) a decreasing cell potential after the Li-poor phase has been evolved into a Li-rich phase. The behavior in the second regime is sensitive to crystallographic orientation.},

  abstract = {The band lineup, or alignment, of semiconductors is investigated via first-principles calculations based on density functional theory (DFT) and many-body perturbation theory (MBPT). Twenty-one semiconductors including C, Si, and Ge in the diamond structure, BN, AlP, AlAs, AlSb, GaP, GaAs, GaSb, InP, InAs, InSb, ZnS, ZnSe, ZnTe, CdS, CdSe, and CdTe in the zinc-blende structure, and GaN and ZnO in the wurtzite structure are considered in view of their fundamental and technological importance. Band alignments are determined using the valence and conduction band offsets from heterointerface calculations, the ionization potential (IP) and electron affinity (EA) from surface calculations, and the valence band maximum and conduction band minimum relative to the branch point energy, or charge neutrality level, from bulk calculations. The performance of various approximations to DFT and MBPT, namely the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) semilocal functional, the Heyd-Scuseria-Ernzerhof (HSE) hybrid functional, and the GW approximation with and without vertex corrections in the screened Coulomb interaction, is assessed using the GW{$\Gamma$}1 approximation as a reference, where first-order vertex corrections are included in the self-energy. The experimental IPs, EAs, and band offsets are well reproduced by GW{$\Gamma$}1 for most of the semiconductor surfaces and heterointerfaces considered in this study. The PBE and HSE functionals show sizable errors in the IPs and EAs, in particular for group II-VI semiconductors with wide band gaps, but are much better in the prediction of relative band positions or band offsets due to error cancellation. The performance of the GW approximation is almost on par with GW{$\Gamma$}1 as far as relative band positions are concerned. The band alignments based on average interfacial band offsets for all pairs of 17 semiconductors and branch point energies agree with explicitly calculated interfacial band offsets with small mean absolute errors of both {$\sim$}0.1eV, indicating a good overall transitivity of the band offsets. The alignment based on IPs from selected nonpolar surfaces performs comparably well in the prediction of band offsets at most of the considered interfaces. The maximum errors are, however, as large as 0.3, 0.4, and 0.7 eV for the alignments based on the average band offsets, branch point energies, and IPs, respectively. This margin of error should be taken into account when performing materials screening using these alignments.},

In the GGA, holes are delocalized over the Co layer, while in GGA+U the charges on the Co layer completely localize, forming distinct Co3+ and Co4+ cations. The leading interactions in GGA are long-range in-plane electrostatics and relaxation effects, whereas in GGA+U Co-Co interactions dominate. Comparison of ground states, c-lattice parameter, and Na1/Na2 ratio with experimental results consistently suggests that GGA is a better approximation for 0.5 \textbackslash textless= x \textbackslash textless= 0.8.},

We explored single- particle fluorescence imaging and spectroscopy techniques to evaluate the photoluminescence of a phosphor particle distinguished from a complex powder mixture and applied a high-resolution single-crystal X-ray diffractometer to determine its crystal structure.

A defect model for lithium over-stoichiometric LiCoO2 is also proposed, which involves negatively charged lithium antisites and positively charged small (hole) polarons. In LiNiO2, a certain amount of Ni3+ ions undergo charge disproportionation and the concentration of nickel ions in the lithium layers is high. Tuning the synthesis conditions may reduce the nickel antisites but would not remove the charge disproportionation. In addition, we find that LiMO2 cannot be doped n- or p-type; the electronic conduction occurs via hopping of small polarons and the ionic conduction occurs via migration of lithium vacancies, either through a monovacancy or divacancy mechanism, depending on the vacancy concentration.},

One can, therefore, suppress or enhance certain native defects in LiFePO4 via tuning the synthesis conditions. On the basis of our results, we provide insights on how to obtain samples in experiments with tailored defect concentrations for targeted applications.

This is accompanied by an increase in sub-bandgap absorption at [similar]1.7 eV, indicating the formation of luminescent trap states. Light soaking causes a splitting of X-ray diffraction (XRD) peaks, suggesting segregation into two crystalline phases. Surprisingly, these photo-induced changes are fully reversible; the XRD patterns and the PL and absorption spectra revert to their initial states after the materials are left for a few minutes in the dark. We speculate that photoexcitation may cause halide segregation into iodide-rich minority and bromide-enriched majority domains, the former acting as a recombination center trap. This instability may limit achievable voltages from some mixed-halide perovskite solar cells and could have implications for the photostability of halide perovskites used in optoelectronics.}

  abstract = {The one-dimensional molecular-crystal model of polaron motion, described in the preceding paper, is here analyzed for the case in which the electronic-overlap term of the total Hamiltonian is a small perturbation. In zeroth order \textemdash i.e., in the absence of this term\textemdash the electron is localized at a given site, p. The vibrational state of the system is specified by a set of quantum-numbers, Nk, giving the degree of excitation of each vibration-mode; the latter differ from the conventional modes in that in each of them, the equilibrium displacement, about which the system oscillates, depends upon the location of the electron. The presence of a nonvanishing electronic-overlap term gives rise to transitions in which the electron jumps to a neighboring site (p \textrightarrow{} p {$\pm$} 1), and in which either all of the Nk remain unaltered (``diagonal'' transitions) or in which some of them change by {$\pm$}1 (``nondiagonal'' transitions). The two types of transitions play fundamentally different roles. At sufficiently low temperatures, the diagonal transitions are dominant. They give rise to the formation of Bloch-type bands whose widths (see Eq. 37) are each given by the product of the electronic-overlap integral, and a vibrational overlap-integral, the latter being an exponentially falling function of the Nk (and, hence, of temperature). In this low-temperature domain, the role of the nondiagonal transitions is essentially one of scattering. In the absence of other scattering mechanisms, such as impurity scattering, they determine the lifetimes of the polaron-band states and, hence, the mean free path for typical transport quantities, such as electron diffusivity. With rising temperature, the probability of the off-diagonal transitions goes up exponentially. This feature, together with the above-mentioned drop in bandwidth, results, e.g., in an exponentially diminishing diffusivity. Eventually, a temperature, the Debye \$\th eta\$, is reached at which the energy uncertainty, , associated with the finite lifetime of the states, is equal to the bandwidth. At this point, the Bloch states lose their individual characteristics (in particular, those which depend upon electronic wave number); the bands may then be considered as ``washed out''. For temperatures \textbackslash textgreaterTt, electron motion is predominantly a diffusion process. The elementary steps of this process consist of the random-jumps between neighboring sites associated with the nondiagonal transitions. In conformance with this picture, the electron diffusivity is, apart from a numerical factor, the product of the square of the lattice distance and the total non-diagonal transition probability, and is therefore an exponentially rising function of temperature. The limit, Jmax, of the magnitude of the electronic overlap term, beyond which the perturbation treatment of the present paper becomes inapplicable, is investigated. For representative values of the parameters entering into the theory, Jmax 0.12 ev and 0.035 ev for the extreme cases of (a) width of the ground-state polaron-band and (b) high-temperature site-jump probabilities (these numbers correspond to electronic bandwidths of 0.24 ev and 0.07 ev, respectively). For electronic bandwidths in excess of these limits, a treatment based on the adiabatic approach is required; preliminary results of such a treatment are given for the above two cases.},

The machine learning to predict GB energy, mobility, and shear coupling using the scattering transform representation is compared and contrasted with learning using a smooth overlap of atomic positions (SOAP) based representation. While predictions using the scattering transform are not as good as those of SOAP, other factors suggest that the scattering transform may yet play an important role in GB structure learning. These factors include the ability of the scattering transform to learn well on larger datasets, in a process similar to deep learning, as well as their ability to provide physically interpretable information about what aspects of the GB structure contribute to the learning through an inverse scattering transform.},

  abstract = {The crystal structures of and phase transitions in the lithium ionic conductor, Li3PS4, which is part of the thioLISICON (LIthium Super Ionic CONductor) family, were studied using high-temperature synchrotron X-ray diffraction measurements and thermal analysis. There are three transitions among the {$\alpha$}, {$\beta$} and {$\gamma$}-phases of this material as a function of temperature. The low-temperature {$\gamma$}-phase transformed to the mediumtemperature {$\beta$}-phase at 573 K, which then transformed to the high-temperature {$\alpha$}-phase at 746 K. The {$\gamma$}-phase is iso-structural with {$\beta$}-Li3PO4 (SG: Pmn21) with an orthorhombic cell with a = 7.70829(11), b = 6.53521(10), and c = 6.1365(7) \AA{} at 297 K. The {$\beta$}-phase has an orthorhombic cell with a = 12.8190(5), b = 8.2195(4), and c = 6.1236(2) \AA{} at 637 K. The apexes of the PS4 tetrahedron are ordered in the same direction in the {$\gamma$}-phase, while in the {$\beta$}-phase, they are ordered in a zig-zag arrangement. The {$\gamma$}-phase showed an ionic conductivity of 3.0 \texttimes{} 10- 7 S cm-1 with an activation energy of 21.3 kJ mol- 1 at room temperature. The {$\beta$}-phase showed an ionic conductivity of 3.0 \texttimes{} 10-2 S cm-1 at 500 K with an activation energy of 15.5 kJ mol- 1.},

  abstract = {Recently Li1.2Ni0.2Mn0.6O2, one of the most promising cathode candidates for next generation Li rechargeable batteries, has been consistently investigated especially because of its high lithium storage capacity, which exceeds beyond the theoretical capacity based on conventional chemical concepts. Yet the mechanism and the origin of the overcapacity have not been clearly understood. Previous reports on simultaneous oxygen evolution during the first delithiation may only explain the high capacity of the first charge process, and not of the subsequent cycles. In this work, we report a clarified interpretation of the structural evolution of Li1.2Ni0.2Mn0.6O2 upon the electrochemical cycling, which is the key element in understanding its anomalously high capacity, through careful study of electrochemical profiles, ex situ X-ray diffraction, HR-TEM, Raman spectroscopy, and first principles calculation. Moreover, we successfully resolved the intermediate states of structural evolution upon electrochemical cycles by intentionally synthesizing sample with large particle size. All observations made through various tools lead to the result that spinel-like cation arrangement and lithium environment are gradually created and locally embedded in layered framework during repeated electrochemical cycling. Moreover, through analyzing the intermediate states of the structural transformation, this gradual structural evolution could explain the mechanism of the continuous development of the electrochemical activity below 3.5 V and over 4.25 V.},

Here there is a close link between the natural system and engineering quantum devices, allowing for dramatic advances in what can be simulated and how these systems can be understood. This subfield has evolved rapidly over the past few years with experimental demonstrations and theoretical advances alike. A broad perspective on this relationship is laid out in a recent review article. Our natural instinct is to harness the newly found and unprecedented problem-solving capabilities of quantum computing and direct them toward the defining challenges of our time. In this Future Energy, we frame and explore the opportunity of applying quantum computing to energy storage. Here we focus on computational materials design of batteries as a specific example.},

These surfaces were preselected by energy estimation via a model that accounts for bond cutting and additionally for polarity compensation in the case of polar surfaces. The model provides a way to quantify the most important contributions to the surface energy. Furthermore, we analyze the relaxation of surface atoms statistically. This clearly shows that SiO4 tetrahedra are rather rigid whereas the local environment of Fe and Li can change strongly under relaxation near the surface. We furthermore compare results obtained by generalized gradient approximation (GGA) and GGA+U exchange correlation functionals. Thus, we estimate the thermodynamic equilibrium shape of Li2FeSiO4 by the Wulff construction scheme for stoichiometric surfaces obtaining crystallites that are terminated by \{110\}, \{010\}, and \{001\} surfaces.},

Using the first-principles method, we predict that 2D nitrogen electride materials can be served as anode materials for NIBs. Particularly, we show that Ca2N meets almost all the requirements of a good NIB anode. Each formula unit of a monolayer Ca2N sheet can absorb up to four Na atoms, corresponding to a theoretical specific capacity of 1138 mAh.g(-1). The metallic character for both pristine Ca2N and its Na intercalated state Na2Ca2N ensures good electronic conduction. Na diffusion along the 2D monolayer plane can be very fast even at room temperature, with a Na migration energy barrier as small as 0.084 eV. These properties are key to the excellent rate performance of an anode material. The average open-circuit voltage is calculated to be 0.18 V vs Na/Na+ for the chemical stoichiometry of Na2Ca2N and 0.09 V for Na4Ca2N. The relatively low average open-circuit voltage is beneficial to the overall voltage of the cell. In addition, the 2D monolayers have very small lattice change upon Na intercalation, which ensures a good cycling stability. All these results,demonstrate that the Ca2N monolayer could be an excellent anode material for NIBs.},

  abstract = {Lattice models, also known as generalized Ising models or cluster expansions, are widely used in many areas of science and are routinely applied to alloy thermodynamics, solid-solid phase transitions, magnetic and thermal properties of solids, and fluid mechanics, among others. However, the problem of finding the true global ground state of a lattice model, which is essential for all of the aforementioned applications, has remained unresolved, with only a limited number of results for highly simplified systems known. In this article, we present the first general algorithm to find the exact ground states of complex lattice models and to prove their global optimality, resolving this fundamental problem in condensed matter and materials theory. We transform the infinite-discrete-optimization problem into a pair of combinatorial optimization (MAX-SAT) and non-smooth convex optimization (MAX-MIN) problems, which provide upper and lower bounds on the ground state energy respectively. By systematically converging these bounds to each other, we find and prove the exact ground state of realistic Hamiltonians whose solutions are completely intractable via traditional methods. Considering that currently such Hamiltonians are solved using simulated annealing and genetic algorithms that are often unable to find the true global energy minimum, and never able to prove the optimality of their result, our work opens the door to resolving long-standing uncertainties in lattice models of physical phenomena.},

  abstract = {Recent experiments have shown that CO reduction on oxide derived Cu nanoparticles (NP) are highly selective toward C2+ products. However, understanding of the active sites on such NPs is limited, because the NPs have {$\sim$}200\,000 atoms with more than 10\,000 surface sites, far too many for direct quantum mechanical calculations and experimental identifications. We show here how to overcome the computational limitation by combining multiple levels of theoretical computations with machine learning. This approach allows us to map the machine learned CO adsorption energies on the surface of the copper nanoparticle to construct the active site visualization (ASV). Furthermore, we identify the structural criteria for optimizing selective reduction by predicting the reaction energies of the potential determining step, {$\Delta$}EOCCOH, for the C2+ product. Based on this structural criterion, we design a new periodic copper structure for CO reduction with a theoretical faradaic efficiency of 97\%.},

The thermal stability of the delithiated materials is found to be in the order: NCA\textbackslash textless VOPO4\textbackslash textless MFP\textbackslash textless FP. Unlike the layered oxides and MFP, VOPO4 does not evolve O2 on heating. Thus VOPO4 is less likely to cause a thermal runaway in batteries at elevated temperature, and so is inherently safer. The lithiated materials LiVOPO4, Li2VOPO4 and LiNi0.8Co0.15Al0.05O2 are found to be stable in the presence of electrolyte, but sealed capsule high-pressure experiments show a phase transformation of VOPO4 \textrightarrow{} HVOPO4 \textrightarrow{} H2VOPO4 when VOPO4 reacts with electrolyte (1 M LiPF6 in EC: DMC=1:1) between 200 and 300 \textdegree C. Using first principles calculations, we confirm that the charged VOPO4 cathode is indeed predicted to be marginally less stable than FP, but significantly more stable than NCA in the absence of electrolyte. An analysis of the reaction equilibria between VOPO4 and EC using a multi-component phase diagram approach yields products and reaction enthalpies that are highly consistent with the experiment results.},

In this contribution, we outline a universal strategy to create ML-based atomistic force fields, which can be used to perform high-fidelity molecular dynamics simulations. This scheme involves (1) preparing a big reference dataset of atomic environments and forces with sufficiently low noise, e.g., using density functional theory or higher-level methods, (2) utilizing a generalizable class of structural fingerprints for representing atomic environments, (3) optimally selecting diverse and non-redundant training datasets from the reference data, and (4) proposing various learning approaches to predict atomic forces directly (and rapidly) from atomic configurations. From the atomistic forces, accurate potential energies can then be obtained by appropriate integration along a reaction coordinate or along a molecular dynamics trajectory. Based on this strategy, we have created model ML force fields for six elemental bulk solids, including Al, Cu, Ti, W, Si, and C, and show that all of them can reach chemical accuracy. The proposed procedure is general and universal, in that it can potentially be used to generate ML force fields for any material using the same unified workflow with little human intervention. Moreover, the force fields can be systematically improved by adding new training data progressively to represent atomic environments not encountered previously.},

  abstract = {Grain boundaries (GBs) can critically influence the microstructural evolution and various material properties. However, a fundamental understanding of GBs in high-entropy alloys (HEAs) is lacking because of the complex couplings of the segregations of multiple elements and interfacial disordering, which can generate new phenomena and challenge the classical theories. Here, by combining large-scale atomistic simulations and machine learning models, we demonstrate the feasibility of predicting the GB properties as functions of four independent compositional degrees of freedom and temperature in a 5D space, thereby enabling the construction of GB diagrams for quinary HEAs. The artificial neural network (ANN), support vector machine (SVM), regression tree, and rational quadratic Gaussian models are trained and tested, and the ANN model yields the best machine learning based predictions. A data-driven discovery further reveals new coupled segregation and disordering effects in HEAs. For instance, interfacial disordering can enhance the co-segregation of Cr and Mn at CrMnFeCoNi GBs. A physics-informed data-driven model is constructed to provide more physical insights and better transferability. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations are used to validate the prediction generality and reveal the underlying segregation mechanisms. This study not only provides a new paradigm enabling the prediction of GB properties in a 5D space, but also uncovers new GB segregation phenomena in HEAs beyond the classical GB segregation models.},

The electrolytes play a fundamental role in terms of current (power) density, the time stability, and the safety of batteries and, as a result, their continuous improvement and innovation are indeed critical to success. In fact, inorganic solid electrolytes pave the way for improving the costeffective development of rechargeable sodium batteries. This review describes a state-of-the-art overview of most of the Na+ conductors for use as electrolytes in sodium/sulphur and ZEBRA batteries. The emphasis of this article is on inorganic solid electrolytes, especially, ceramic and glass-ceramic electrolytes as promising alternatives applicable to all solid-state batteries. As part of a continuous effort to find new materials that operate at room temperature and moderate temperatures, NASICON electrolytes will also be considered. Polymer electrolytes based on poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) are also very suitable for all solid-state batteries. Hence, the review focuses on ion transport based on the observed conductivity, electrolyte preparation, safety and environmental impact.}

Here, potentially transformative research is represented by constructing GB property diagrams as functions of temperature and bulk composition, also called ``complexion diagrams,'' as a general materials science tool on par with phase diagrams. However, a GB has five macroscopic (crystallographic) degrees of freedom (DOFs). It is essentially a ``mission impossible'' to construct property diagrams for GBs as a function of five DOFs by either experiments or modeling. Herein, we combine isobaric semi-grand canonical ensemble hybrid Monte Carlo and molecular dynamics (hybrid MC/MD) simulations with a genetic algorithm (GA) and deep neural network (DNN) models to tackle this grand challenge. The DNN prediction is \textasciitilde 10\^8 faster than atomistic simulations, thereby enabling the construction of the property diagrams for millions of distinctly different GBs of five DOFs. Notably, excellent prediction accuracies have been achieved for not only symmetric-tilt and twist GBs, but also asymmetric-tilt and mixed tilt-twist GBs; the latter are more complex and much less understood, but they are ubiquitous and often limit the performance properties of real polycrystals as the weak links. The data-driven prediction of GB properties as function of temperature, bulk composition, and five crystallographic DOFs (i.e., in a 7D space) opens a new paradigm.},

Because non-stoichiometric surfaces are potential dependent and since the potential varies during discharge and charge, we study the thermodynamic stability of facets, terminations, and steps as a function of potential. This suggests that different facets, terminations, and sites may dominate in charge relative to those for discharge. We find very low thermodynamic overpotentials (\textbackslash textless0.2 V) for both discharge and charge at many sites on the facets studied. These low thermodynamic overpotentials for both discharge and charge are in very good agreement with the low kinetic overpotentials observed in recent experiments. However, there are other predicted paths for discharge/charge that have higher overpotentials, so the phase space available for the electrochemistry opens up with overpotential.},

The investigated solids include cubic diamond C, silicon Si, germanium Ge, and the zero-gap semiconductor gray tin -Sn. The main objective of this work is to examine the performance of the screened hybrid functional HSE proposed by Heyd, Scuseria, and Ernzerhof J. Chem. Phys. 118, 8207 2003; J. Chem. Phys. 124, 219906E 2006 for calculating phonon-dispersion relations. We find that all local and semilocal functionals tend to underestimate the phonon frequencies, with the errors increasing with increasing atomic mass. For -Sn, semilocal functionals even qualitatively fail to describe the dispersion of the highest optical phonon mode. We show that this is related to semilocal functionals predicting -Sn to be a metal, whereas experimentally it is a zero-gap semiconductor. The HSE functional yields the correct electronic band structure resulting in qualitatively correct phonon-dispersion relations for all four solids. Quantitatively, the phonon frequencies are slightly overestimated using HSE, in particular for the lighter elements C and Si. Our results are compared to previously reported theoretical findings.},

This study employs high-resolution multinuclear/multidimensional solid-state NMR techniques, with in situ synchrotron-based techniques, to study the prototype conversion material RuO2. The experiments, together with theoretical calculations, show that a major contribution to the extra capacity in this system is due to the generation of LiOH and its subsequent reversible reaction with Li to form Li2O and LiH. The research demonstrates a protocol for studying the structure and spatial proximities of nanostructures formed in this system, including the amorphous solid electrolyte interphase that grows on battery electrodes.},

  abstract = {Digitizing large collections of scientific literature can enable new informatics approaches for scientific analysis and meta-analysis. However, most content in the scientific literature is locked-up in written natural language, which is difficult to parse into databases using explicitly hard-coded classification rules. In this work, we demonstrate a semi-supervised machine-learning method to classify inorganic materials synthesis procedures from written natural language. Without any human input, latent Dirichlet allocation can cluster keywords into topics corresponding to specific experimental materials synthesis steps, such as ``grinding'' and ``heating'', ``dissolving'' and ``centrifuging'', etc. Guided by a modest amount of annotation, a random forest classifier can then associate these steps with different categories of materials synthesis, such as solid-state or hydrothermal synthesis. Finally, we show that a Markov chain representation of the order of experimental steps accurately reconstructs a flowchart of possible synthesis procedures. Our machine-learning approach enables a scalable approach to unlock the large amount of inorganic materials synthesis information from the literature and to process it into a standardized, machine-readable database.},

  abstract = {Body-centered cubic (bcc) refractory multicomponent alloys are of great interest due to their remarkable strength at high temperatures. Meanwhile, further optimizing the chemical compositions of these alloys to achieve a combination of high strength and room-temperature ductility remains challenging, which would require systematic predictions of the correlated alloy properties across a vast compositional space. In the present work, we performed first-principles calculations with the special quasi-random structure (SQS) method to predict the unstable stacking fault energy (\$\textbackslash gamma\_\{usf\}\$) of the \$(1\textbackslash bar10)[111]\$ slip system and the \$(1\textbackslash bar10)\$-plane surface energy (\$\textbackslash gamma\_\{surf\}\$) for 106 individual binary, ternary and quaternary bcc solid-solution alloys with constituent elements among Ti, Zr, Hf, V, Nb, Ta, Mo, W, Re and Ru. Moreover, with the first-principles data and a set of physics-informed descriptors, we developed surrogate models based on statistical regression to accurately and efficiently predict \$\textbackslash gamma\_\{usf\}\$ and \$\textbackslash gamma\_\{surf\}\$ for refractory multicomponent alloys in the 10-element compositional space. Building upon binary and ternary data, the surrogate models show outstanding predictive ability in the high-order multicomponent systems. The ratio between \$\textbackslash gamma\_\{surf\}\$ and \$\textbackslash gamma\_\{usf\}\$ is a parameter to reflect the potency of intrinsic ductility of an alloy based on the Rice model of crack-tip deformation. Therefore, using the surrogate models, we performed a systematic screening of \$\textbackslash gamma\_\{usf\}\$, \$\textbackslash gamma\_\{surf\}\$ and their ratio over 112,378 alloy compositions to search for alloy candidates that may have enhanced strength-ductile synergies. Search results were also confirmed by additional first-principles calculations.},

The bulk conduction was separated from others by complexplane impedance analysis. At high temperatures, i.e., T.170 K, the activation energy required for bulk conduction is 0.34 eV, while that required for dielectric relaxation is 0.25 eV, and the spectral intensity of the relaxation peak is thermally activated with an energy of 0.097 eV. This is consistent with a polaronic picture in which the bulk conduction involves the excitation of carriers through the band gap, Eg , between the two energy states participating in the electrical transport; in such a picture the hopping process of the holes in the lower-energy states has a hopping energy WH , and the temperature dependence of the bulk conduction is proportional to exp[2(WH1Eg/2)/kBT]/T. The present experiment obtained these energies independently, i.e., (WH1Eg/2)\textbackslash textgreater0.35 eV, Eg/2\textbackslash textgreater0.097 eV, and WH\textbackslash textgreater0.25 eV. At low temperatures, i.e., T,170 K, the non-Arrhenius regime is observed, which might be interpreted as a usual crossover from a thermally activated process to a tunnel-hopping process.},

One way to avoid the waste of a large fraction of the radiation emitted from hot objects is to tailor the thermal emission spectrum according to the desired application. This strategy has been successfully applied to photonic-crystal emit- ters at moderate temperatures 3\textendash 8 , but is exceedingly difficult for hot emitters (\textbackslash textgreater1,000 K) 9\textendash 14 .

We experimentally demonstrate a proof-of-principle incandescent emitter with efficiency approach- ing that of commercial fluorescent or light-emitting diode bulbs, but with exceptional reproduction of colours and scalable power. The ability to tailor the emission spectrum of high-temperature sources may find applications in thermophotovoltaic energy conversion 15\textendash 18 and lighting.},

Experimental studies have shown that the conductivity along the (001) basal plane is four orders of magnitude larger than the conductivity along the [001] direction. In the context of the small polaron model, a cluster approach was used to compute quantities controlling the mobility of localized electrons and holes, i.e., the reorganization energy and the electronic coupling matrix element that enter Marcus' theory. The calculation of the electronic coupling followed the generalized Mulliken-Hush approach using the complete active space self-consistent field method. Our findings demonstrate an approximately three orders of magnitude anisotropy in both electron and hole mobility between directions perpendicular and parallel to the c axis, in good accord with experimental data. The anisotropy arises from the slowness of both electron and hole mobilities across basal oxygen planes relative to that within iron bilayers between basal oxygen planes. Interestingly, for elementary reaction steps along either of the directions considered, there is only less than one order of magnitude difference in mobility between electrons and holes, in contrast to accepted classical arguments. Our findings indicate that the most important quantity underlying mobility differences is the electronic coupling, albeit the reorganization energy contributes as well. The large values computed for the electronic coupling suggest that charge transport reactions in hematite are adiabatic in nature. The electronic coupling is found to depend on both the superexchange interaction through the bridging oxygen atoms and the d-shell electron spin coupling within the Fe-Fe donor-acceptor pair, while the reorganization energy is essentially independent of the electron spin coupling.},

In the context of the small polaron model, a cluster approach was used to compute quantities controlling the mobility of localized electrons and holes, i.e., the reorganization energy and the electronic coupling matrix element that enter Marcus' theory. The calculation of the electronic coupling followed the generalized Mulliken-Hush approach using the complete active space self-consistent-field (CASSCF) method and the quasidiabatic method. Our findings indicate that hole mobility is more than three orders of magnitude larger than electron mobility in both (001) and [001] lattice directions. The difference arises mainly from the larger internal reorganization energy calculated for electron-transport relative to hole-transport processes while electronic couplings have similar magnitudes. The much larger hole mobility versus electron mobility in alpha-Cr2O3 is in contrast to similar hole and electron mobilities in hematite alpha-Fe2O3 previously calculated. Our calculations also indicate that the electronic coupling for all charge-transfer processes of interest is smaller than for the corresponding processes in hematite. This variation is attributed to the weaker interaction between the metal 3d states and the O(2p) states in chromia than in hematite, leading to a smaller overlap between the charge-transfer donor and acceptor wave functions and smaller superexchange coupling in chromia. Nevertheless, the weaker coupling in chromia is still sufficiently large to suggest that charge-transport processes in chromia are adiabatic in nature. The electronic coupling is found to depend on both the superexchange interaction through the bridging oxygen atoms and the d-shell electron-spin coupling within the Cr-Cr donor-acceptor pair, while the reorganization energy is essentially independent of the electron-spin coupling.},

The growth of materials databases and emerging informatics approaches finally offer the opportunity to transform this practice into data- and knowledge-driven rational design. By using data from the AFLOW repository for high-throughput ab-initio calculations, we have generated Quantitative Materials Structure-Property Relationship (QMSPR) models to predict eight critical electronic and thermomechanical materials properties, such as the metal/insulator classification, band gap energy, bulk and shear moduli, Debye temperature, and heat capacity. The prediction accuracy obtained with these QMSPR models approaches training data for virtually any stoichiometric inorganic crystalline material. The success and universality of these models is attributed to the construction of new materials descriptors\textemdash referred to as the universal Property-Labeled Materials Fragments (PLMF). The representation requires only minimal structural input and affords straightforward model interpretation in terms of simple heuristic design rules that guide rational materials design.

Our simulation model shows good reproduction of the observed olivine-type structure of LiFePO4. The most favorable intrinsic defect is the Li-Fe "anti-site" pair in which a Li ion (on the M1 site) and an Fe ion (on the M2 site) are interchanged. This type of anti-site defect or "intersite exchange" has been observed in olivine silicates. The lowest Li migration energy is found for the pathway along the [010] channel, with a nonlinear, curved trajectory between adjacent Li sites. Trends in dopant substitution energetics of a range of cations with charges varying from +2 to +5 are also examined. Low favorable energies are found only for divalent dopants on the Fe site (such as Mn), which is in accord with experimental work. Our results suggest that, on energetic grounds, LiFePO4 is not tolerant to aliovalent doping (e.g., Al, Ga, Zr, Ti, Nb, Ta) on either Li (M1) or Fe (M2) sites.},

Major advances in rechargeable batteries for portable electronics, electric vehicles and large-scale grid storage will depend on the discovery and exploitation of new high performance materials, which requires a greater fundamental understanding of their properties on the atomic and nanoscopic scales. This review describes some of the exciting progress being made in this area through use of computer simulation techniques, focusing primarily on positive electrode (cathode) materials for lithium-ion batteries, but also including a timely overview of the growing area of new cathode materials for sodium-ion batteries. In general, two main types of technique have been employed, namely electronic structure methods based on density functional theory, and atomistic potentials-based methods. A major theme of much computational work has been the significant synergy with experimental studies. The scope of contemporary work is highlighted by studies of a broad range of topical materials encompassing layered, spinel and polyanionic framework compounds such as LiCoO2, LiMn2O4 and LiFePO4 respectively. Fundamental features important to cathode performance are examined, including voltage trends, ion diffusion paths and dimensionalities, intrinsic defect chemistry, and surface properties of nanostructures.},

  abstract = {A novel least-squares fitting approach is presented to obtain classical force fields from trajectory and force databases produced by ab initio (e.g., Car-Parrinello) molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. The method was applied to derive effective nonpolarizable three-site force fields for liquid water at ambient conditions from Car-Parrinello MD simulations in the Becke-Lee-Yang-Parr approximation to the electronic density functional theory. The force-matching procedure includes a fit of short-ranged nonbonded forces, bonded forces, and atomic partial charges. The various parameterizations of the water force field differ by an enforced smooth cut-off applied to the short-ranged interaction term. These were obtained by fitting to the trajectory and force data produced by Car-Parrinello MD simulations of systems of 32 and 64 H(2)O molecules. The new water force fields were developed assuming both flexible or rigid molecular geometry. The simulated structural and self-diffusion properties of liquid water using the fitted force fields are in close agreement with those observed in the underlying Car-Parrinello MD simulations. The resulting empirical models compare to experiment much better than many conventional simple point charge (SPC) models. The fitted potential is also shown to combine well with more sophisticated intramolecular potentials. Importantly, the computational cost of the new models is comparable to that for SPC-like potentials.},

  abstract = {Lead halide perovskites have over the last few years attracted considerable interest as photo absorbers in PV-applications with record efficiencies now reaching 22 \%. It has recently been found that not only the composition but also the precise stoichiometry is important for the device performance. Recent reports have, for example, demonstrated small amount of PbI2 in the perovskite films to be beneficial for the overall performance of both the standard perovskite, CH3NH3PbI3, as well as for the mixed perovskites (CH3NH3)x(CH(NH2)2)(1-x)PbBryI(3-y). In this work a broad range of characterization techniques including: X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), photo electron spectroscopy (PES), transient absorption spectroscopy (TAS), UV-VIS, electroluminescence (EL), photoluminescence (PL), and confocal PL-mapping have been used to further understand the importance of remnant PbI2 in perovskite solar cells. Our best devices were over 18 \% efficient, and had in line with previous results a small amount of excess PbI2. For the PbI2-deficient samples, the photocurrent dropped which could be attributed to accumulation of organic species at the grain boundaries, low charge carrier mobility, and decreased electron injection into the TiO2. The PbI2-deficient compositions did, however, also have advantages. The record Voc was as high as 1.20 V and was found in PbI2-deficient samples. This was correlated with high crystal quality, longer charge carrier lifetimes, and high PL yields and was rationalized as a consequence of the dynamics of the perovskite formation. We further found the ion migration to be obstructed in the PbI2-deficient samples which decreased the JV-hysteresis and increased the photo-stability. PbI2-deficient synthesis conditions can thus be used to deposit perovskites with excellent crystal quality but with the downside of grain boundaries enriched in organic species which act as a barrier towards current transport. Exploring ways to tune the synthesis conditions to give the high crystal quality obtained under PbI2-poor condition while maintaining the favorable grain boundary characteristics obtained under PbI2-rich conditions would thus be a strategy towards more efficiency devices.},

  abstract = {The concept of local lattice distortion (LLD) is of fundamental importance in the understanding of properties of high-entropy alloys and, more generally, of multi-principal element alloys (MPEAs). Despite previous experimental and computational efforts, the unambiguous evaluation of the static (due to atomic size difference) and dynamic (due to thermal fluctuation) LLD is still elusive. Here, as a first step, we develop a machine learning interatomic potential based on an efficient ``learning-on-the-fly'' scheme for CoFeNi, a prototypical ternary MPEA. Using this potential, we perform molecular dynamics simulations to calculate the elastic moduli of single- and polycrystalline CoFeNi. The results are in excellent agreement with theoretical and experimental data. As a second step, we design a simulation framework allowing the determination of the effects of static and dynamic LLD, thermal expansion, and chemical short-range order on the elastic properties of our prototypical MPEA. The results indicate that not only the average value of LLD, but also its probability distribution affect the elastic properties of MPEAs. In addition, we show that a variety of commonly used LLD indicators, e.g., atomic strain, pair distribution function, and bond-length distribution, correlate with each other. Our results not only shed light on the of LLD in MPEAs, but also demonstrate the capabilities of our machine learning potential as a powerful tool for the development and characterization of novel alloys with designed properties.},

  abstract = {The demonstration of high entropy alloys (HEAs), or more generally multi-principal-element alloys (MPEAs), which display a greater resistance to softening at elevated temperatures and embrittlement at cryogenic temperatures, has offered an accessible alternative alloying process for materials scientists and engineers. Although solidification is a fundamental process in synthesis of alloys which strongly affects their microstructure and properties, a firm understanding of this process in HEAs is scarce. Here, using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, we study the rapid solidification of the multi-principal-element CoFeNiPd alloy as a prototypical single-phase HEA. Our simulations reveal an intense competition between fcc and bcc structures during homogenous nucleation in this alloy. According to our numerical analyses, the crystalline fcc phase is thermodynamically the most stable structure in this alloy, which is in agreement with the experimental observations. We show that formation of the fcc structure can be facilitated through heterogeneous nucleation by including a pre-existing fcc seed in the liquid phase. Interestingly, we illustrate that altering the crystal structure of the seed from fcc to bcc leads to obtaining a single phase bcc alloy. Our detailed analyses confirm that the tendency of HEA systems to undergo crystallization (rather than amorphisation) at fast cooling rates is owing to the neutral chemical affinity and similar atomic size of their constitutive elements. Our findings suggest that rapid solidification accompanied with heterogeneous (e.g. seed-assisted) nucleation could be a promising processing route to control the microstructure and properties of the HEAs.},

While this latter regime has garnered less focused application than,               e.g.               , metalloenzymes in many excellent catalysis studies, we show that the technique provides high utility in materials-focused energy storage research. Here, sensitivities to the local atomic structure and hybridization schemes are discussed in detail. Similarly, the effect of lithiation on oxidation, delocalization, and shifts in ligand valence energy levels are all readily apparent in the analyzed results. Finally, the TDDFT projections clearly reveal the directional dependencies of the valence band at each of the vanadium sites. Our results demonstrate laboratory-based X-ray spectroscopy instrumentation is a viable route for attaining well-resolved VTC-XES features for inorganic compounds of 3d transition metals, even for samples of limited quantity or suffering from sensitivity to the atmosphere. The experimental results are in good agreement with results produced by real-space Green's function and time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) methods, respectively. Hence, we propose that VTC-XES, when equipped with appropriate theoretical support, can be a valuable complement to X-ray absorption pre-edge features for more detailed characterization of a compound's electronic structure. We expect similar analyses will find application in a broad range of materials chemistry research and provide both fundamental and applied insights.},

We then outline a methodology that mixes GGA and GGA+U total energies (using known binary formation data for calibration) to more accurately predict formation enthalpies. We demonstrate that for a test set of 49 ternary oxides, our methodology can reduce the mean absolute relative error in calculated formation enthalpies from approximately 7.7\textendash 21\% in GGA+U to under 2\%. As another example we show that neither GGA nor GGA+U alone accurately reproduces the Fe-P-O phase diagram; however, our mixed methodology successfully predicts all known phases as stable by naturally stitching together GGA and GGA+U results. As a final example we demonstrate how our technique can be applied to the calculation of the Li-conversion voltage of LiFeF3. Our results indicate that mixing energies of several functionals represents one avenue to improve the accuracy of total energy computations without affecting the cost of calculation.},

  abstract = {High voltage and high thermal safety are desirable characteristics of cathode materials, but difficult to achieve simultaneously. This work uses high-throughput density functional theory computations to evaluate the link between voltage and safety (as estimated by thermodynamic O2 release temperatures) for over 1400 cathode materials. Our study indicates that a strong inverse relationship exists between voltage and safety: just over half the variance in O2 release temperature can be explained by voltage alone. We examine the effect of polyanion group, redox couple, and ratio of oxygen to counter-cation on both voltage and safety. As expected, our data demonstrates that polyanion groups improve safety when comparing compounds with similar voltages. However, a counterintuitive result of our study is that polyanion groups produce either no benefit or reduce safety when comparing compounds with the same redox couple. Using our data set, we tabulate voltages and oxidation potentials for over 105 combinations of redox couple/anion, which can be used towards the design and rationalization of new cathode materials. Overall, only a few compounds in our study, representing limited redox couple/ polyanion combinations, exhibit both high voltage and high safety. We discuss these compounds in more detail as well as the opportunities for designing safe, high-voltage cathodes.},

  abstract = {The density functional theory (DFT) method is a widely used tool that can guide targeted searches exploring numerous possible chemistries according to any property of interest. However, acquiring accurate DFT results from a large chemical search space is still a major challenge for computationalists because it requires considerable time and resources. Therefore, advances in this field are urgently needed. In particular, the development of new materials for Li ion batteries would benefit greatly because of the increasing demand for power, energy density, stability during operation, and safety. We have previously demonstrated the use of multivariate partial least squares (PLS) regression to augment DFT calculations and accelerate material screening. However, the linear function scheme in the PLS method does not accurately reproduce the material values near the extreme ends of the attribute dataset. In this study, we examined neural network (NN) modeling, which offers a more flexible framework, to improve the accuracy of the values. We used the compositional space for LiMXO4 (M \textendash{} main group elements, X \textendash{} group XIV and group XV), which is a candidate solid electrolyte material. The evolved NN models were substantially more accurate and could generalize better than the PLS models for values inside and outside the dataset that they were trained on. We also explored NN modeling with common literature data as descriptors for target properties and found that the predictive capability was comparable with that of DFT data-based modeling. The relevance of the input variables was then identified using two of the most common techniques: the causal index method and sensitivity analysis. Our method offers a simple, practical approach for merging theoretical and experimental databases to accelerate the screening of a wider variety of materials.},

In this work, we investigated the origin of capacity fading during the charge process of an air-isolated Li ion battery with garnet Li 6.625 La 3 Zr 1.625 Ta 0.375 O 12 (LLZrTaO) solid electrolyte, Li metal anode, and LiFePO 4 +carbon (LFP+C) active cathode material. Cyclic voltammetry measurements of fabricated Li/LLZrTaO/(LLZrTaO+C) and Li/LLZrTaO/Al cells revealed a rise and an absence, respectively, of oxidation current which points to the garnet oxide electrolyte being decomposed via a reaction with carbon. XRD patterns of the solid electrolyte at post-charging showed no detectable impurity phases, suggesting that that the decomposition product(s) is (are) likely made up of light elements. Based from first-principles calculation, the decomposition route may involve formation of defective garnet by Li removal, oxygen release, and formation of products such as Li 2 CO 3 and possibly of CO 2 ; formation of the latter product is facilitated at elevated operating temperatures. Among the evaluated base garnet compounds (Li 5+x La 3 M 2 O 12 , with M: Nb Ta for x = 0 and M: Zr, Ti, Hf for x = 2), Li 7 La 3 Hf 2 O 12 is predicted to be the most stable against Li 2 CO 3 formation. A strong correlation has been determined between stability at charging and the electronegativity of the M cation, that is, the smaller the M electronegativity, the more stable is the garnet compound against carbon reaction.},

We present a combined CALPHAD and machine learning approach leading to well-calibrated metamodels able to predict structural parameters quickly and accurately for any desired inputs. To generate data, we have used a known precipitation model to perform annealing simulations at several temperatures, for varying Fe and Si concentrations. Thereafter, we used the data to develop metamodels for mean radius and volume fraction via the k-Nearest Neighbour algorithm. The metamodels reproduce closely the results from the precipitation model over the entire annealing timescale. Our analysis via parallel coordinate charts shows the effect of composition, temperature, and annealing time, and helps identify combinations thereof that lead to the desired mean radius and volume fraction for nanocrystals. This work contributes to understanding the linkages between processing parameters and microstructural characteristics responsible for achieving targeted properties, and illustrates ways to reduce the time from alloy discovery to deployment.},

The cycling performance is improved noticeably when the material is cycled between potential windows of 5.3-2.5 V compared to 4.6-2.5 V. Diffraction data show that structural changes occur at high voltages, the solid-state NMR data of the same samples indicating that the high voltage processes above 4.4 V are associated with Li removal from the structure, in addition to electrolyte decomposition. The NMR spectra of the discharged samples show that cation rearrangements in the transition metal layers have occurred. The XAS spectra confirm that theMn oxidation state remains unchanged at 4+, whereas Ni2+ is oxidized to Ni4+ on charging to 4.4 V, returning to Ni2+ on discharge, independent of the final charge voltage. A significant change of the shape of the Ni edge is observed in the 4.6-5.3 V potential range on charge, which is ascribed to a change in the Ni local environment.NoO2 evolution was detected based on ex situ analysis of the gases evolved in the batteries, the TEM data showing that thick passivating films form on the electrodes. The results suggest that at least some of the oxygen loss from these lithium-excess materials occurs via a mechanism involving electrolyte decomposition.},

We find a strong solute-grain boundary interaction for Nb, Mo, and Ti that is consistent with experimental observations of the effects of these alloying elements on delaying recrystallization and the austenite-to-ferrite transformation in low-carbon steels. In addition, we compute the solute-solute interactions as a function of solute pair distance in the grain boundary, which suggest co-segregation for these large solutes at intermediate distances in striking contrast to the bulk.},

  doi = {10.1103/PhysRevB.21.4427},
  abstract = {A general treatment of core-level binding-energy shifts in metals relative to the free atom is introduced and applied to all elemental metals in the Periodic Table. The crucial ingredients of the theoretical description are (a) the assumption of a fully screened final state in the metallic case and (b) the (Z+1) approximation for the screening valence charge distribution around the core-ionized site. This core-ionized site is, furthermore, treated as an impurity in an otherwise perfect metal. The combination of the complete screening picture and the (Z+1) approximation makes it possible to introduce a Born-Haber cycle which connects the initial state with the final state of the core-ionization process. From this cycle it becomes evident that the main contributions to the core-level shift are the cohesive energy difference between the (Z+1) and Z metal and an appropriate ionization energy of the (Z+1) atom (usually the first ionization potential). The appearance of the ionization potential in the shift originates from the assumption of a charge-neutral final state, while the contribution from the cohesive energies essentially describes the change of bonding properties between the initial and final state of the site. The calculated shifts show very good agreement with available experimental values (at present, for 19 elements). For the other elements we have made an effort to combine experimental ionization potentials with theoretical calculations in order to obtain accurate estimates of some of the atomic-core-level binding energies. Such energies together with measured metallic binding energies give "pseudoexperimental" shifts for many elements. Our calculated core-level shifts agree exceedingly well also with these data. For some of the transition elements the core-level shift shows a deviating behavior in comparison with that of neighboring elements. This is shown to be due to a difference in the atomic ground-state configuration, such as, for example, d5s in chromium relative to the dns2 configuration in vanadium and manganese. When the core-level shift is referred to, the dns2 (or dn+1s) atomic configuration for all the elements in a transition series, a quite regular behavior of the shift is found. However, some structure can still be observed originating from a change of screening within the d band from a bonding to an antibonding type as one proceeds through the series. For elements beyond the coin metals the screening of a core hole is performed by p electrons, which provide a less effective screening mechanism than the d electrons for the transition metals. The coin metals are intermediate cases, partly due to a dominating s-electron screening and partly due to d-electron bonding in the initial state. The effect of the electron-density redistribution between the free atom and the solid on the core-level shift is particularly striking in the case of the rare-earth elements Pr-Sm and Tb-Tm. Here the remarkable situation is that a deep core electron is less bound in the atom than in the solid. Also for the actinides the electronic redistribution upon condensation gives rise to pronounced effects on the core-level shifts. Further, it is shown that the measured 6p32 binding energy in metallic uranium provides a clear demonstration of the occupation of the 5f level in this metal. The present treatment of the core-level shift for bulk metallic atoms can easily be generalized to surface atoms. From an empirical relation for the surface energy a simple expression for the shift of the surface core-level relative to the bulk can be derived. For the earlier transition metals, it is found that the core electrons are more bound at the surface than in the bulk, while for the heavier ones the opposite situation exists. This change of sign of the surface shift depends on the bonding-antibonding division of the d band. To illustrate how the present approach can be applied to alloy systems, a treatment of core-level shifts for rare-gas atoms implanted in noble metals is undertaken.},

We introduce a classical thermodynamics-based model to explain the underlying growth inhibition mechanism by means of the competitive and face-selective electrostatic adsorption of non-zinc complex ions at alkaline conditions. The performance of these nanowires rivals that of vapour-phase-grown nanostructures, and their low-temperature synthesis (\textbackslash textless60 \textdegree C) is favourable to the integration and in situ fabrication of complex and polymer-supported devices. We illustrate this capability by fabricating an all-inorganic light-emitting diode in a polymeric microfluidic manifold. Our findings indicate that electrostatic interactions in aqueous crystal growth may be systematically manipulated to synthesize nanostructures and devices with enhanced structural control.},

The crystal structure consists of chains of corner-sharing tetrahedra running along [100] and built up by S2- and Cl- ions. The tetrahedra are centered alternately by phosphorus (four S neighbors) and Ag1 atoms (two S and two Cl). The contact with the chains is achieved via Ag2 ions, which are located a little bit outside of a triangular plane formed by S2- and Cl- ions. Ag15(PS4)4Cl3 crystallizes in the space group I over(4, -) 3 d (a = 14.838(4) \textbackslash AA; Z = 4). The main features of the crystal structure are the almost ideal PS4 and Ag(1)S4 tetrahedra, whereas the tetrahedral coordination of the Ag2 atoms built up by one Cl- and three S2- ions is markedly distorted. Concerning the arrangements of the tetrahedra both crystal structures show relationships to Ag3PS4 (enargite type), whose crystallographic data are given too in this paper. \textcopyright{} 2006 Elsevier Masson SAS.

Parameters for both torsional and nonbonded energetics have been derived, while the bond stretching and angle bending parameters have been adopted mostly from the AMBER all-atom force field. The torsional parameters were determined by fitting to rotational energy profiles obtained from ab initio molecular orbital calculations at the RHF/6-31G*//RHF/6-31G* level for more than 50 organic molecules and ions. The quality of the fits was high with average errors for conformational energies of less than 0.2 kcal/mol. The force-field results for molecular structures are also demonstrated to closely match the ab initio predictions. The nonbonded parameters were developed in conjunction with Monte Carlo statistical mechanics simulations by computing thermodynamic and structural properties for 34 pure organic liquids including alkanes, alkenes, alcohols, ethers, acetals, thiols, sulfides, disulfides, aldehydes, ketones, and amides. Average errors in comparison with experimental data are 2\% for heats of vaporization and densities. The Monte Carlo simulations included sampling all internal and intermolecular degrees of freedom. It is found that such non-polar and monofunctional systems do not show significant condensed-phase effects on internal energies in going from the gas phase to the pure liquids.},

  abstract = {The solid electrolyte interface (SEI) forms as a result of side reactions between the electrolyte and electrode surfaces in Li-ion batteries and can adversely impact performance by impeding Li-ion transport and diminishing the storage capacity of the battery. To gain a detailed understanding of the impact of the SEI on electrolyte structure, atomistic molecular dynamics simulations of the electrode/electrolyte interface were performed in the presence and absence of the SEI under applied voltages. The composition of the SEI was guided by a wealth of data from experiments and allowed to vary across the simulations. A novel computational approach was implemented that showed significant computational speedup compared to fully polarizable electrode simulations, yet, retained the correct qualitative physics for the electrolyte. A force-matching algorithm was used to construct a new force field for the pure electrolyte, LiPF6 in ethylene carbonate, which was developed from ab initio molecular dynamics simulations. The electrode/electrolyte interface was included using a simple, physically motivated model, which includes the polarization of the conducting graphitic electrode by the electrolyte and the application of an external voltage. Changes in the structure of the electrolyte at the interface as a function of applied voltage, the thickness of the SEI layer, and composition of the SEI provide molecular level insight into the species present at these interfaces and potential clues to the effect of the SEI on transport. It is noted that, with increasing SEI thickness and LiF content, lithium ions are drawn closer to the SEI surface, which implies that these interfaces favor desolvation and promote more rapid lithium transport.},

In an organic electrolyte (1 M NaClO4 in PC), Na2.7Ru4O9 shows three redox peaks in its cyclic voltammogram between 2.8 and 3.9 V vs. Na. In an aqueous (1 M Na2SO4) electrolyte, Na2.7Ru4O9 exhibits three anodic peaks during the first charge, similar to the behavior observed in the organic electrolyte. However, the three peaks become a single broad peak over the following cycles. Electrochemical data and ex-situ XRD results indicate that once Na ions are removed from the Na2.7Ru4O9 structure containing the maximum amount of sodium, only a portion (\textbackslash textless60\%) can be re-intercalated and that the aqueous electrolyte allows a lower reversible capacity than the nonaqueous electrolyte.},

In this direction, aluminum oxide (Al2O3) is one of the most widely adopted coating materials due to its easy synthesis and low material cost. Nevertheless, the effect of Al2O3 coating on carrier ion diffusion has been investigated mainly for Li ion batteries, and the corresponding understanding for emerging Na ion batteries is currently missing. Using ab initio molecular dynamics calculations, herein, we first find that, unlike lithiation, sodiation of Al2O3 is thermodynamically unfavorable. Nonetheless, there can still exist a threshold in the Na ion content in Al2O3 before further diffusion into the adjacent active material, delivering a new insight that both thermodynamics and kinetics should be taken into account to describe ionic diffusion in any material media. Furthermore, Na ion diffusivity in NaxAl2O3 turns out to be much higher than Li ion diffusivity in LixAl2O3, a result opposite to the conventional stereotype based on the atomic radius consideration. While hopping between the O-rich trapping sites via an Na-O bond breaking/making process is identified as the main Na ion diffusion mechanism, the weaker Na-O bond strength than the Li-O counterpart turns out to be the origin of the superior diffusivity of Na ions.},

Alloying elements that segregate strongly to grain boundaries can lead to a preference for nanocrystalline structure, and to be most stable the grain boundary segregated state would need to be preferred to forming any other phase or solute configuration, including a solid solution, ordered compounds, or solute precipitates. In this paper, a stability criterion is developed by comparing the enthalpy of the grain boundary segregated state against such stable bulk phases. This enthalpic criterion is also translated into a lattice model framework to enable the use of Monte Carlo simulations to incorporate entropic and geometric effects in assessing nanocrystalline stability. Monte Carlo simulations show that entropy can play a role in stabilizing nanocrystalline states, leading to duplex structures, and also in forming a grain boundary network preferentially over a disordered or amorphous-like bulk phase.},

However, such batteries require relatively stringent safety precautions, making large-scale systems very complicated and expensive. The application of solid electrolytes is currently limited because they attain practically useful conductivities (10(-2) S cm(-1)) only at 50-80 \textdegree C, which is one order of magnitude lower than those of organic liquid electrolytes. Here, we report a lithium superionic conductor, Li(10)GeP(2)S(12) that has a new three-dimensional framework structure. It exhibits an extremely high lithium ionic conductivity of 12 mS cm(-1) at room temperature. This represents the highest conductivity achieved in a solid electrolyte, exceeding even those of liquid organic electrolytes. This new solid-state battery electrolyte has many advantages in terms of device fabrication (facile shaping, patterning and integration), stability (non-volatile), safety (non-explosive) and excellent electrochemical properties (high conductivity and wide potential window).},

Our approach focuses on a screening ``pipeline'', using a genetic algorithm for first stage screening and multiple filtering stages for further refinement. An important step forward is to expand our diversity of candidate compounds, including both synthetic and property-based measures of diversity. For example, top monomer pairs from our screening are all donor-donor (D- D) combinations, in contrast with the typical donor-acceptor (D-A) motif used in organic photovoltaics. We also find a strong ``sequence effect'', in which the average HOMO-LUMO gap of tetramers changes by {$\sim$}0.2 eV as a function of monomer sequence (e.g., ABBA versus BAAB); this has rarely been explored in conjugated polymers. Beyond such optoelectronic optimization, we discuss other properties needed for high-efficiency organic solar cells, and applications of screening methods to other areas, including nonfullerene n-type materials, tandem cells, and improving charge and exciton transport.},

However, significant limitations remain, in particular, for red-emitting phosphors due to the inherently broad excitation bands which result from the underlying d-f transitions and span large parts of the visible spectral region. Guided by density functional theory calculations on the ligand structure of the non-RE Bi 3+ ion, we report here on an alternative class of phosphors, [(Y,Sc)(Nb,V)O 4 :Bi 3+ ], which exhibit homogeneous Bi 3+ luminescence. In these materials, adjustment of the cation fractions enables dedicated tailoring of the excitation scheme within the spectral range of {$\sim$}340-420 nm and, in the meanwhile, allows for tunable emission spanning from about 450 nm (blue) to 647 nm (orange-red). The practical absence of any overlap between the emission and excitation spectra addresses the issues of emission color purity and visible reabsorption. Tailoring through band-gap modulation is achieved by single or parallel substitution of Nb by V and Y by Sc. Such topochemical design of the ligand configuration enables modulation of the electronic band gap and thus provides a new path toward tunable phosphors, exemplarily based on Bi 3+ single doping.},

In this work, we use ab initio calculations to demonstrate that a facile mechanism for recharging Li2O2 exists. Rather than the direct decomposition pathway of Li2O2 into Li and O2 suggested by equilibrium thermodynamics, we find an alternative reaction pathway based on topotactic delithiation of Li2O2 to form off-stoichiometric Li2-xO2 compounds akin to the charging mechanism in typical Li-ion intercalation electrodes. The low formation energy of bulk Li2-xO2 phases confirms that this topotactic delithiation mechanism is rendered accessible at relatively small overpotentials of {$\sim$}0.3\textendash 0.4 V and is likely to be kinetically favored over Li2O2 decomposition. Our findings indicate that at the Li2O2 particle level there are no obstacles to increase the current density, and point to an exciting opportunity to create fast charging Li-air systems.},

The factors that affect Li mobility in layered lithium transition metal oxides are systematically studied in this paper by means of first-principles calculations. In close packed oxides octahedral ions diffuse by migrating through intermediate tetrahedral sites. Our results indicate that the activation barrier for Li hopping is strongly affected by the size of the tetrahedral site and the electrostatic interaction between Li+ in that site and the cation in the octahedron that shares a face with it. The size of the tetrahedral site is determined by the c-lattice parameter which has a remarkably strong effect on the activation barrier for Li migration. The effect of other factors such as cation mixing and doping with nontransition metal ions can be interpreted quantitatively in terms of the size and electrostatic effect. A general strategy to design high rate electrode materials is discussed.},

However, LABs are hindered by both poor rate capability and significant polarization in cell voltage, primarily due to the formation of Li2O2 in the air cathode. Here, by employing hybrid density functional theory, we show that the formation of small polarons in Li2O2 limits electron transport. Consequently, the lowelectron mobility {$\mu$}=10-10\textendash 10-9 cm2/Vs contributes to both the poor rate capability and the polarization that limit the LAB power and energy densities. The self-trapping of electrons in the small polarons arises from the molecular nature of the conduction band states of Li2O2 and the strong spin polarization of the O 2p state. Our understanding of the polaronic electron transport in Li2O2 suggests that designing alternative carrier conduction paths for the cathode reaction could significantly improve the performance of LABs at high current densities.},

As a consequence, the superoxide requires a much lower nucleation energy than the peroxide, explaining why it can be observed as the discharge product in some Na-O2 batteries. As the superoxide can be recharged (decomposed) at much lower overpotentials than the peroxide, these findings are important to create highly reversible Na-O2 batteries. We derive the specific electrochemical conditions to nucleate and retain Na-superoxides and comment on the importance of considering the nanophase thermodynamics when optimizing an electrochemical system.},

H of garnet formation is mainly controlled by two factors, the strengthening of the ionic bond in Ln 2 O 3 with decreasing ionic radius of Ln 3؉ and the deviation of the ionic radius of Ln 3؉ from the optimum size for the garnet structure.

The experimental reflectivity and EELS were measured for PtAl2 and showed good agreement with the theoretical spectra. The yellow color of PtAl2 is associated with a bulk plasmon at 3 eV. We predict that the optical properties of hypothetical intermediate alloys would show a smooth evolution with composition. The details of this change can be understood by examination of the underlying density of states (DOS). The predicted small sphere extinction spectra and quality factors show a strong surface plasmon resonance for these materials, with PtAl2 having the optimum performance.

Our method constructs a triangular g-matrix from the matrix representation of the total electron magnetic moment in the basis of the spin-orbit coupled wave functions by means of a projection technique. Principal g-values are obtained in the standard fashion by forming from the triangular matrix g the tensor G=gg(t) and diagonalizing it. In principle, the scheme allows to calculate the spin-orbit orbital Zeeman cross term which usually gives the dominating contribution to the EPR g-shifts for any multiplicity. We have implemented this approach into a multireference spin-orbit configuration interaction (MRSOCI) program [M. Kleinschmidt et al., J. Chem. Phys. 124, 124101 (2006)]. Test applications are carried out for various triplet state sytems. The g-shifts of several of main group diatomics with X (3)Sigma(g)(-) ground state are investigated at the level of ab initio MRSOCI. We obtain perpendicular g-shifts which underestimate experimental Delta g(perpendicular) values from literature by approximately 13\% on the average. For a set of organic triplet state molecules we employ the combined density functional theory/multireference configuration interaction (DFT/MRCI) technique [S. Grimme and M. Waletzke, J. Chem. Phys. 111, 5645 (1999)] to reduce the computational costs of the spin-free correlation problem. This approach yields principal g-values that match experiment well in many cases. Due to the small absolute g-shifts, a rigorous comparison will require the inclusion of first-order contributions such as the relativistic mass correction and gauge correction terms which have not been included here. For the triplet state dication trans-(CNSSS)(2)(2+) the principal g-shifts Delta g(a)=-0.3 ppt, Delta g(b)=17.5 ppt, and Delta g(c)=26.6 ppt are significantly larger and compare rather well to the experimental values Delta g(1)=-0.1+/-0.2 ppt, Delta g(2)=14.8+/-0.2 ppt, and Delta g(3)=24.8+/-0.1 ppt [A. Berces et al., Magn. Reson. Chem. 37, 353 (1999)]. In comparison to conventional truncated sum-over state techniques based on Rayleigh-Schrodinger perturbation theory, our new variational approach shows, in practice, robust and advantageous convergence characteristics with respect to the size of the many-particle basis set. We demonstrate that the DFT/MRSOCI technology is a very feasible means to compute reliable g-shifts for large organic triplet systems at low computational cost.},

  abstract = {In this study, we report on the development of a new garnet phosphor with enhanced optical properties and cost reduction. Samples were prepared using the solid-solution method, in which the chemical unit and substitutions with cation-size mismatch were combined. Solid solutions between two garnet structure compounds, green phosphor Lu3Al5O12:Ce3+ (LuAG:Ce3+) and orange phosphor Lu2CaMg2Si3O12:Ce3+ (Lu3-xCaxAl2-2xMg2xAl3-3xSi3xO12:Ce3+), constituted the complete solid-solution range x (x = 0-1). The crystal structures of all the compounds were discerned through Rietveld refinement based on the X-ray diffraction patterns. The unique occupancy of \{Lu/Ca\}, [Al/Mg], (Al/Si), and O atoms in the solid-solution samples was identified. Optical properties were classified in terms of the excitation and emission spectra, quantum yield, and temperature-dependent photoluminescence intensity. To investigate the relationship between the structural and optical changes, Ba2+ ions (employed for cation-size mismatch) were substituted into dodecahedral and octahedral sites at various concentrations. Finally, we report the development of a new green garnet phosphor via the use of a solid-solution design and cation-size mismatch, the emission intensity of which was measured 116\% higher than that of commercial LuAG:Ce3+.},

  abstract = {Lithium-ion (Li-ion) batteries have been developed for electric vehicle (EV) applications, owing to their high energy density. Recent research and development efforts have been devoted to finding the next generation of cathode materials for Li-ion batteries to extend the driving distance of EVs and lower their cost. LiNi(0.5)Mn(1.5)O(4) (LNMO) high-voltage spinel is a promising candidate for a next-generation cathode material based on its high operating voltage (4.75 V vs. Li), potentially low material cost, and excellent rate capability. Over the last decade, much research effort has focused on achieving a fundamental understanding of the structure-property relationship in LNMO materials. Recent studies, however, demonstrated that the most critical barrier for the commercialization of high-voltage spinel Li-ion batteries is electrolyte decomposition and concurrent degradative reactions at electrode/electrolyte interfaces, which results in poor cycle life for LNMO/graphite full cells. Despite scattered reports addressing these processes in high-voltage spinel full cells, they have not been consolidated into a systematic review article. With this perspective, emphasis is placed herein on describing the challenges and the various approaches to mitigate electrolyte decomposition and other degradative reactions in high-voltage spinel cathodes in full cells.},

  abstract = {To understand the difference in reversible energy storage capacity between the O3-type layered Na and Li compounds, we use first principles calculations to study and contrast the effect of two well-known destabilization mechanisms, transformation into the spinel-type structures and cation mixing due to transition metal migration. This study is performed on the layered oxides at the A(0.5)MO(2) composition, where A = (Na, Li) and M is a 3d transition metal. We find that while all Li(0.5)MO(2) compounds have strong driving forces and low energy kinetic paths to transform to the spinel structure, Na(0.5)MO(2) compounds do not have thermodynamic driving forces to transform to spinel type structures. We also find that transition metal mobility is higher in Li layered compounds than in Na layered compounds because of the unusual activated state for transition metal hopping. For many compounds, migration goes along an oct-tet-oct path, but transition metal migration needs to be assisted by alkali migration into a tetrahedral site forming activated A(tet)-M(tet) defects; substituting Na for Li in the layered structure results in increased transition metal migration barriers due to the larger size of Na(+) ions. Overall, our findings indicate that Na compounds in the layered O3 structure have fundamentally different destabilization mechanisms to those of Li compounds. This distinction allows superior battery electrode performance in many Na compounds and offers optimistic perspective on finding many high energy density Na electrodes that cycle with stable high capacity.},

  abstract = {In materials containing 1D lithium diffusion channels, cation disorder can strongly affect lithium intercalation processes. This work presents a model to explain the unusual transport properties of monoclinic LiMnBO3, a material determined by scanning electron microscopy and synchrotron X-ray diffraction to contain a wide particle size distribution and Mn/Li antisite disorder. First-principles calculations indicate that Mn occupying Li sites obstruct the 1D lithium diffusion channel along the [001] direction. While channel blockage by the antisites significantly lowers Li mobility in large particles, Li kinetics in small particles and particle surfaces are found to be less sensitive to the presence of antisite disorder. Thus, in an electrode containing a large particle size distribution, smaller particles have higher Li mobility, and the measured Li diffusivity as determined by potentiostatic intermittent titration test varies as a function of particle size. The Li capacity in monoclinic LiMnBO3 is kinetically controlled by the fraction of large particles with antisite disorder, but is not intrinsically limited. These results strongly suggest that particle nanosizing will significantly enhance the electrochemical performance of LiMnBO3.},

  abstract = {Lithium (Li)-ion batteries (LIB) have governed the current worldwide rechargeable battery market due to their outstanding energy and power capability. In particular, the LIB's role in enabling electric vehicles (EVs) has been highlighted to replace the current oil-driven vehicles in order to reduce the usage of oil resources and generation of CO 2 gases. Unlike Li, sodium is one of the more abundant elements on Earth and exhibits similar chemical properties to Li, indicating that Na chemistry could be applied to a similar battery system. In the 1970s-80s, both Na-ion and Li-ion electrodes were investigated, but the higher energy density of Li-ion cells made them more applicable to small, portable electronic devices, and research efforts for rechargeable batteries have been mainly concentrated on LIB since then. Recently, research interest in Na-ion batteries (NIB) has been resurrected, driven by new applications with requirements different from those in portable electronics, and to address the concern on Li abundance. In this article, both negative and positive electrode materials in NIB are briefl y reviewed. While the voltage is generally lower and the volume change upon Na removal or insertion is larger for Na-intercalation electrodes, compared to their Li equivalents, the power capability can vary depending on the crystal structures. It is concluded that cost-effective NIB can partially replace LIB, but requires further investigation and improvement.},

The thermodynamic stability of oxygen and lithium vacancies and their most stable configurations are examined by first-principles density functional theory calculations. The underlying chemical mechanism is analyzed by a molecular orbital method. The weaker ionic bonding between Ni and O than between Co and O is found to be the main cause for the imperfect structure of LNO crystals. Based on these calculations, phase diagrams of the Li\textendash (Ni,Co)\textendash O system were simulated. The crystals containing vacancies are included as independent phases in the simulation. This approach enabled investigation of the relationship between the processing conditions and vacancy formation. The O and Li vacancy pairs are simulated to appear with high temperature processing. Based on the calculation of energy barriers, we speculate that these vacancy pairs provide an alternative migration route for Ni ions, which causes the observed structural instability. The effect of oxygen partial pressure was also examined. The first-principles calculation results were compared with experimental results, which showed excellent agreement confirming the validity of the models and calculation methods used in this study.},

The STF films contain mixed valence Fe ions, with a lower average valence state present in the single crystal film. The films are under an in-plane compressive strain, and exhibit an out-of-plane magnetic easy axis due to magnetoelastic effects. The nanopillars in the double-epitaxial STF films act as single ferromagnetic domains, whereas the single-crystal films show a maze-like domain structure. Composition fluctuations seen in single-crystal films are suppressed in the double-epitaxial structure, which has a lower electrical leakage current. First-principles modeling supports a tendency for Fe ions to occupy adjacent sites. The correlations between the valence state and distribution of the Fe ions, the microstructure, and the magnetic and electrical properties provide a general method of tailoring the properties of perovskite films, which have immense technological value in a range of multiferroic, ferromagnetic, optical, spintronic and hybrid devices.},

Practical synthetic methods of nitrides, such as hydrogen-reduction and nitridation or carbothermal reduction and nitridation reactions were studied with special attention. This study enabled us to calculate proper conditions for synthesis of Sr2Si5N8 phase, which is drawing attention as a new phosphor material for light emitting diodes. The types of impurities appearing with break of the proper synthetic conditions were also investigated, which may provide information about optimizing synthesis conditions. Synthesis of Sr2Si5N8:Eu phosphor using SiO2, instead of conventionally used Si3N4, was predicted by first-principles calculations, and we succeeded in synthesizing Sr2Si5N8:Eu phosphor for the first time using all oxide raw materials under normal pressure on the basis.

Herein, we address challenges in developing thick LbL electrodes of multi-wall carbon nanotubes (MWNTs) using conventional dip- and spray-LbL processes, and present a solution to overcome these challenges. The vacuum-assisted spray-LbL process using porous carbon substrates enabled a linear growth of LbL-MWNT electrodes with a 600 time decrease in their fabrication time. This result was attributed to the enhanced surface interactions between MWNTs and substrate via increased surface areas, enhanced capillary forces, physical entrapment in pores, and changes in hydrodynamic drag forces. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) revealed high surface area carbon nanotube networks comprised of individual MWNT's. The spray MWNT electrodes delivered a high gravimetric energy of 100 W h kg1 at high gravimetric power of 50 kW kg1, which is higher than those of most carbon nanotube electrodes reported. Moreover, the spray MWNT electrodes delivered the highest energy capacity per unit area (up to 300 mW h cm2 at 0.4 mW cm2 among the LbL electrodes reported, and showed excellent retention of energy capacity up to 100 mW h cm2 at high power capacity of 200 mW cm2. These performance values are higher or comparable to the most advanced battery electrodes for high energy capacity per unit area.}

(3) These properties are intimately dependent on, and can therefore be tailored by, the microstructure, orientation, and strain state of the film. Here, we demonstrate the growth of cubic Sr(Ti,Fe)O(3) (STF) films with an unusual self-assembled nanocomposite microstructure consisting of (100) and (110)-oriented crystals, both of which grow epitaxially with respect to the Si substrate and which are therefore homoepitaxial with each other. These structures differ from previously reported self-assembled oxide nanocomposites, which consist either of two different materials (4-7) or of single-phase distorted-cubic materials that exhibit two or more variants. (8-12) Moreover, an epitaxial nanocomposite SrTiO(3) overlayer can be grown on the STF, extending the range of compositions over which this microstructure can be formed. This offers the potential for the implementation of self-organized optical/ferromagnetic or ferromagnetic/ferroelectric hybrid nanostructures integrated on technologically important Si substrates with applications in magnetooptical or spintronic devices.},

Using ab initio modeling, the superior Li intercalation activity is explained by both stabilization of the delithiated state and increased topological cation disorder, which counter-intuitively facilitates Li transport. Our results indicate that through engineering of defect chemistry, the basic mechanism can be modified from one-dimensional to three-dimensional conduction, thereby improving kinetics. Combined with the inherent stability of the borate group, the enhanced electrochemical properties should reinvigorate search in borate chemistry for new safe and high-energy cathode materials.},

  abstract = {Conventional density functional theory (DFT) fails to describe accurately the London dispersion essential for describing molecular interactions in soft matter (biological systems, polymers, nucleic acids) and molecular crystals. This has led to several methods in which atom-dependent potentials are added into the Kohn-Sham DFT energy. Some of these corrections were fitted to accurate quantum mechanical results, but it will be tedious to determine the appropriate parameters to describe all of the atoms of the periodic table. We propose an alternative approach in which a single parameter in the low-gradient (lg) functional form is combined with the rule-based UFF (universal force-field) nonbond parameters developed for the entire periodic table (up to Lr, Z = 103), named as a DFT-ulg method. We show that DFT-ulg method leads to a very accurate description of the properties for molecular complexes and molecular crystals, providing the means for predicting more accurate weak interactions across the periodic table.},

In this study, we fabricated one-dimensional spinel Li4 Ti5 O12 (LTO) nanofibers using an electrospinning technique and studied the Zr(4+) doping effect on the lattice, electronic structure, and resultant electrochemical properties of Li-ion batteries (LIBs). Accommodating a small fraction of Zr(4+) ions in the Ti(4+) sites of the LTO structure gave rise to enhanced LIB performance, which was due to structural distortion through an increase in the average lattice constant and thereby enlarged Li(+) diffusion paths rather than changes to the electronic structure. Insulating ZrO2 nanoparticles present between the LTO grains due to the low Zr(4+) solubility had a negative effect on the Li(+) extraction capacity, however. These results could provide key design elements for LTO anodes based on atomic level insights that can pave the way to an optimal protocol to achieve particular functionalities.},

  author = {Kingma, Diederik P and Ba, Jimmy Lei},
  abstract = {We introduce Adam, an algorithm for first-order gradient-based optimization of stochastic objective functions, based on adaptive estimates of lower-order mo-ments. The method is straightforward to implement, is computationally efficient, has little memory requirements, is invariant to diagonal rescaling of the gradients, and is well suited for problems that are large in terms of data and/or parameters. The method is also appropriate for non-stationary objectives and problems with very noisy and/or sparse gradients. The hyper-parameters have intuitive interpre-tations and typically require little tuning. Some connections to related algorithms, on which Adam was inspired, are discussed. We also analyze the theoretical con-vergence properties of the algorithm and provide a regret bound on the conver-gence rate that is comparable to the best known results under the online convex optimization framework. Empirical results demonstrate that Adam works well in practice and compares favorably to other stochastic optimization methods. Finally, we discuss AdaMax, a variant of Adam based on the infinity norm.}

Such databases now contain millions of calculations at the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) level of theory, representing an enormous investment of computational resources. Although it is now feasible to carry out large numbers of calculations using more accurate methods, such as meta-GGA functionals, recomputing the entirety of a database with a higher-fidelity method is impractical and would not effectively leverage the value embodied in existing calculations. Instead, we propose in this work a general procedure by which higher-fidelity, low-coverage calculations (e.g., meta-GGA calculations for selected chemical systems) can be combined with lower-fidelity, high-coverage calculations (e.g., an existing database of GGA calculations) in a robust and scalable manner to yield improved phase stability predictions. We demonstrate our scheme using legacy GGA(+\textbackslash textit\{U\}) calculations and new r\$\^2\$SCAN meta-GGA calculations from the Materials Project and illustrate its application to solid and aqueous phase stability. We discuss practical considerations for constructing mixed phase diagrams and present guidelines for prioritizing high-fidelity calculations for maximum benefit.},

These models represent a molecule as a graph using only the distance between atoms (nodes). They do not, however, consider the spatial direction from one atom to another, despite directional information playing a central role in empirical potentials for molecules, e.g. in angular potentials. To alleviate this limitation we propose directional message passing, in which we embed the messages passed between atoms instead of the atoms themselves. Each message is associated with a direction in coordinate space. These directional message embeddings are rotationally equivariant since the associated directions rotate with the molecule. We propose a message passing scheme analogous to belief propagation, which uses the directional information by transforming messages based on the angle between them. Additionally, we use spherical Bessel functions and spherical harmonics to construct theoretically well-founded, orthogonal representations that achieve better performance than the currently prevalent Gaussian radial basis representations while using fewer than 1/4 of the parameters. We leverage these innovations to construct the directional message passing neural network (DimeNet). DimeNet outperforms previous GNNs on average by 76\% on MD17 and by 31\% on QM9. Our implementation is available online.},

Lett. 92, 246401 (2004)] is a promising approach for including dispersion in approximate density functional theory exchange-correlation functionals. Indeed, an improved description of systems held by dispersion forces has been demonstrated in the literature. However, despite many applications, standard general tests on a broad range of materials including traditional ``hard''matter such asmetals, ionic compounds, and insulators are lacking. Such tests are important not least because many of the applications of the vdW-DF method focus on the adsorption of atoms and molecules on the surfaces of solids. Here we calculate the lattice constants, bulk moduli, and atomization energies for a range of solids using the original vdW-DF and several of its offspring.We find that the original vdW-DF overestimates lattice constants in a similar manner to how it overestimates binding distances for gas-phase dimers. However, some of the modified vdW functionals lead to average errors which are similar to those of PBE or better. Likewise, atomization energies that are slightly better than from PBE are obtained from the modified vdW-DFs. Although the tests reported here are for hard solids, not normally materials for which dispersion forces are thought to be important, we find a systematic improvement in cohesive properties for the alkali metals and alkali halides when nonlocal correlations are accounted for.}

Most of the established methods, however, rely on local properties and are thus unable to take global changes in the electronic structure into account, which result from long-range charge transfer or different charge states. In this work we overcome this limitation by introducing a fourth-generation high-dimensional neural network potential that combines a charge equilibration scheme employing environment-dependent atomic electronegativities with accurate atomic energies. The method, which is able to correctly describe global charge distributions in arbitrary systems, yields much improved energies and substantially extends the applicability of modern machine learning potentials. This is demonstrated for a series of systems representing typical scenarios in chemistry and materials science that are incorrectly described by current methods, while the fourth-generation neural network potential is in excellent agreement with electronic structure calculations.},

Lithium resources are confi rmed to be unevenly distributed in South America, and the cost of the lithium raw materials has roughly doubled from the fi rst practical application in 1991 to the present and is increasing due to global demand for lithium-ion accumulators. Since the electrochemical equivalent and standard potential of sodium are the most advantageous after lithium, sodium based energy storage is of great interest to realize lithium-free high energy and high voltage batteries. However, to the best of our knowledge, there have been no successful reports on electrochemical sodium insertion materials for battery applications; the major challenge is the negative electrode and its passivation. In this study, we achieve high capacity and excellent reversibility sodium-insertion performance of hard-carbon and layered NaNi 0.5 Mn 0.5 O 2 electrodes in propylene carbonate electrolyte solutions. The structural change and passivation for hard-carbon are investigated to study the reversible sodium insertion. The 3-volt secondary Na-ion battery possessing environmental and cost friendliness, Na + -shuttlecock hard-carbon/NaNi 0.5 Mn 0.5 O 2 cell, demonstrates steady cycling performance as next generation secondary batteries and an alternative to Li-ion batteries},

  abstract = {We present a comparison of the most common finite-size supercell correction schemes for charged defects in density functional theory calculations. Considered schemes include those proposed by Makov and Payne (MP), Lany and Zunger (LZ), and Freysoldt, Neugebauer, and Van de Walle (FNV). The role of the potential alignment is also assessed. Supercells of various sizes are considered and the corrected formation energies are compared to the values obtained by extrapolation to large supercells. For defects with localized charge distributions, we generally find that the FNV scheme slightly improves upon the LZ one, while the MP scheme generally overcorrects except for point-charge-like defects. We also encountered more complex situations in which the extrapolated values do not coincide. Inspection of the defect electronic structure indicates that this occurs when the defect Kohn-Sham states are degenerate with band-edge states of the host. \textcopyright{} 2011 Elsevier B.V.

The Ch/X partial structures remain nearly unchanged upon the reversible phase transitions. Crystal chemical and crystallographic relations between HT and LT modifications based on the Frank-Kasper model of tetrahedral close packing are discussed. X-ray single-crystal data for HT-Li(6)PS(5)I show the electron density of the disordered Li to be smeared out over an extended region preferably inside face-sharing double tetrahedra. A series of temperature-dependent powder neutron data for Li(6)PS(5)I gives clear evidence for an HT/LT phase transition at approximately 175 K with an ordering of the Li atoms in different polyhedra with coordination numbers between three and four.},

A series of quaternary solid solutions Li(7)PS(6-x)Se(x) (0 \textbackslash textless or = x \textbackslash textless or = 6) were characterised by X-ray crystallography and magic-angle spinning nuclear magnetic resonance (MAS-NMR) spectroscopy. The high-temperature (HT) modifications were studied by single-crystal investigations (both F43m, Z=4, Li(7)PS(6): a=9.993(1) A, Li(7)PSe(6): a=10.475(1) A) and show the typical argyrodite structures with strongly disordered Li atoms. HT-Li(7)PS(6) and HT-Li(7)PSe(6) transform reversibly into low-temperature (LT) modifications with ordered Li atoms. X-ray powder diagrams show the structures of LT-Li(7)PS(6) and LT-Li(7)PSe(6) to be closely related to orthorhombic LT-alpha-Cu(7)PSe(6). Single crystals of the LT modifications are not available due to multiple twinning and formation of antiphase domains. The gradual substitution of S by Se shows characteristic site preferences closely connected to the functionalities of the different types of chalcogen atoms (S, Se). High-resolution solid-state (31)P NMR is a powerful method to differentiate quantitatively between the distinct (PS(4-n)Se(n))(3-) local environments. Their population distribution differs significantly from a statistical scenario, revealing a pronounced preference for P-S over P-Se bonding. This preference, shown for the series of LT samples, can be quantified in terms of an equilibrium constant specifying the melt reaction Se(P)+S(2-) \textbackslash textless==\textbackslash textgreaterS(P)+Se(2-), prior to crystallisation. The (77)Se MAS-NMR spectra reveal that the chalcogen distributions in the second and third coordination sphere of the P atoms are essentially statistical. The number of crystallographically independent Li atoms in both LT modifications was analysed by means of (6)Li\{(7)Li\} cross polarisation magic angle spinning (CPMAS).},

However, the possibility of multiple solutions to the ROKS equations - with the associated difficulty of automatically selecting the physically meaningful solution - limits its usefulness for intensive applications such as long-time Born-Oppenheimer molecular dynamics. We present an implementation of ROKS for excited states which prescribes the physically correct solution from an overlap criterion and guarantees that this solution is stationary, allowing for straightforward evaluation of nuclear gradients. The method is used to benchmark ROKS for vertical excitation energies of small and large organic dyes and for the calculation of Stokes shifts. With common density functional approximations, ROKS vertical excitation energies, and Stokes shifts show similar accuracy to those from time-dependent density functional theory and {$\Delta$}-self-consistent-field approaches. Advantages of the ROKS approach for excited state structure and molecular dynamics are discussed.},

Here, we demonstrate a new approach to stabilize Li metal anodes using a hybrid organic/inorganic artificial solid electrolyte interphase (ASEI) deposited directly on the Li metal surface by self-healing electrochemical polymerization (EP), and atomic layer deposition (ALD). This hybrid protection layer is thin, flexible, ionically conductive, and electrically insulating.

In the first part the application of Pulay's DIIS method {$\sim$}direct inversion in the iterative subspace! to the iterative diagonalization of large matrices will be discussed. Our approach is stable, reliable, and minimizes the number of order Natoms 3 operations. In the second part, we will discuss an efficient mixing scheme also based on Pulay's scheme. A special ``metric'' and a special ``preconditioning'' optimized for a plane-wave basis set will be introduced. Scaling of the method will be discussed in detail for non-self-consistent and self-consistent calculations. It will be shown that the number of iterations required to obtain a specific precision is almost independent of the system size. Altogether an order Natoms 2 scaling is found for systems containing up to 1000 electrons. If we take into account that the number of k points can be decreased linearly with the system size, the overall scaling can approach Natoms . We have implemented these algorithms within a powerful package called VASP {$\sim$}Vienna ab initio simulation package!. The program and the techniques have been used successfully for a large number of different systems {$\sim$}liquid and amorphous semiconductors, liquid simple and transition metals, metallic and semiconducting surfaces, phonons in simple metals, transition metals, and semiconductors! and turned out to be very reliable.},

  abstract = {Density functional theory calculations of the diffusion of hydrogen atoms on 23 transition metal surfaces in their closed-packed structure have been carried out. The d-metals chosen are all the metals in the 4th, 5th and 6th periods, from Sc to Au, except Mn, Tc, and Hf. Potential energy surfaces of H atom on these metals are constructed and the diffusion barrier from one minima to another is compared with nudged elastic band calculations. Most of the minimum energy paths have a single activation barrier, except on two surfaces where a dip in the bridge position (W and Pt) is observed. Trends in the adsorption and activation energies are observed where the former is explained with the d-band model. All the activation energies for diffusion are relatively low, or from 0.04 eV for Pt to 0.28 eV on Y and Zr. Finally, we estimate the temperature where tunneling effects should start to take place. \textcopyright{} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

  abstract = {We trained a large, deep convolutional neural network to classify the 1.2 million high-resolution images in the ImageNet LSVRC-2010 contest into the 1000 dif-ferent classes. On the test data, we achieved top-1 and top-5 error rates of 37.5\% and 17.0\% which is considerably better than the previous state-of-the-art. The neural network, which has 60 million parameters and 650,000 neurons, consists of five convolutional layers, some of which are followed by max-pooling layers, and three fully-connected layers with a final 1000-way softmax. To make train-ing faster, we used non-saturating neurons and a very efficient GPU implemen-tation of the convolution operation. To reduce overfitting in the fully-connected layers we employed a recently-developed regularization method called " dropout " that proved to be very effective. We also entered a variant of this model in the ILSVRC-2012 competition and achieved a winning top-5 test error rate of 15.3\%, compared to 26.2\% achieved by the second-best entry.}

The Rietveld refinement results show that the trigonal system (space group: P\textasciimacron 3c1) with the lattice parameters a = 0.9724 nm, c = 1.3596nm are obtained. Its intrinsic electrical conductivity of 1.43\texttimes 10-8 Scm-1 is higher than that of LiFePO4 and as the same order of Li3V2(PO3)4. The electrochemical measurement results show that there are two plateaus (3.77V and 4.51 V) and three plateaus (3.77 V, 4.51V and 4.75 V) in the potential ranges of 2.0\textendash 4.6V and 2.0\textendash 4.8 V, respectively. In the range of 2.0\textendash 4.6 V, two discharge plateaus (4.46V and 3.74 V) can be observed and 110mAhg-1 of discharge capacity is achieved. The Rietveld refinement result of the X-ray diffraction (XRD) data at the end of discharge after the first cycle suggests that the structural reversibility can be retained during electrochemical reactions in Li9V3(P2O7)3(PO4)2. In the range of 2.0\textendash 4.8 V, almost six lithium ions are extracted and the trigonal structure is still recovered after 30 cycles. Therefore, this novel layered vanadium monodiphosphate offers a promising candidate as cathode material for lithium-ion batteries.},

The model is solved through an iterative technique where successive iterations improve the estimates of the polycrystal's elastic constants. Convergence of the solution provides the self-consistent elastic constants, which are the polycrystal's elastic constants resulting from continuity between local and far-field stress and strains. Iterative solutions prior to convergence are the bounds on the elastic constants including the Voigt-Reuss and Hashin-Shtrikman bounds. The second part of the article establishes a formal link between the present model and single-crystal elastic anisotropy. An analysis from a dataset containing 2176 inorganic crystalline compounds, spanning all crystallographic symmetries, is pro- vided. The role of elastic anisotropy and related properties such as crystalline structure and elastic sta- bility are discussed as it relates to the model.},

However, phase formation, Li loss during preparation, and therefore reliably obtaining high Li-ion conductivities remains challenging. In this work we show that an additional defect chemical species needs to be considered: oxygen vacancies. We prove existence of oxygen vacancies in all six investigated sample types which were Ta-, Al-, and Ga-stabilized cubic Li7La3Zr2O12 (LLZO) polycrystals and Ta-stabilized LLZO single crystals. Isotope exchange 3-D analysis was used to characterize surface oxygen exchange k* and bulk oxygen diffusion D* mitigated by the oxygen vacancies present in the LLZO variants. Remarkably high values of k* = 10-11\textendash 10-8 cm s-1 and D* = 10-15\textendash 10-11 cm{$^2$} s-1 were found at 350\textdegree C in air. In a further data analysis, the differences between the compositions are investigated, the concentration of oxygen vacancies is estimated, and the possible effects on the cation defect chemistry and phase formation of LLZO are discussed.},

The computational method converges as a power law, so that highly accurate results can be achieved with modest resources. We present the most accurate ground state energy {$\sim$}with no small parameter! to date for polaron problems, 21 digits for the one-dimensional {$\sim$}1D! polaron at intermediate coupling. The dimensionality effects on polaron band dispersion, effective mass, and electronphonon {$\sim$}el-ph! correlation functions are investigated in all coupling regimes. It is found that the crossover to large effective mass of the higher-dimensional polaron is much sharper than the 1D polaron. The correlation length between the electron and phonons decreases significantly as the dimension increases. Our results compare favorably with those of the quantum Monte Carlo, dynamical mean-field theory, density-matrix renormalization-group, and Toyozawa variational methods. We demonstrate that the Toyozawa wave function is qualitatively correct for the ground-state energy and the two-point electron-phonon correlation functions, but fails for the three-point functions. Based on this finding, we propose an improved Toyozawa variational wave function.}

Surrogate models that can be trained to predict properties of polymers are becoming commonplace. Nevertheless, these models do not utilize the full breadth of the knowledge available in datasets, which are oftentimes sparse; inherent correlations between different property datasets are disregarded. Here, we demonstrate the potency of multi-task learning approaches that exploit such inherent correlations effectively. Data pertaining to 36 different properties of over 13,000 polymers are supplied to deep-learning multi-task architectures. Compared to conventional single-task learning models, the multi-task approach is accurate, efficient, scalable, and amenable to transfer learning as more data on the same or different properties become available. Moreover, these models are interpretable. Chemical rules, that explain how certain features control trends in property values, emerge from the present work, paving the way for the rational design of application specific polymers meeting desired property or performance objectives.},

This allows us to compare the Kohn-Sham gaps to those obtained by accurate many-body perturbation-theory-based optimized potential methods. In addition, the resulting quasiparticle band gap is compared to experimental gaps. In the GLLB model potential, the exchangecorrelation hole is modeled using a generalized gradient approximation GGA energy density and the response of the hole-to-density variations is evaluated by using the common-denominator approximation and homogeneous electron-gas-based assumptions. In our modification, we have chosen the PBEsol potential as the GGA to model the exchange hole and add a consistent correlation potential. The method is implemented in the GPAW code, which allows efficient parallelization to study large systems. A fair agreement for Kohn-Sham and the quasiparticle band gaps with semiconductors and other band gap materials is obtained with a potential which is as fast as GGA to calculate.},

Depending on the ordering/disordering of transition metal ions on octahedral sites, spinels were assigned to either ordered P4332 P or disordered Fd3m F space groups. The spinels of the two symmetry groups differed significantly in fast discharge rate capability. Extensive characterization was employed to identify the source of the difference. Vibrational spectroscopy techniques FTIR and Raman, in situ and ex situ XRD and impedance spectroscopy did not reveal any sign of structural degradation for electrochemically inferior P4332 spinels even after rigorous cycling. The poor performance was assigned to an intrinsic property, the lower electrical conductivity of the cation ordered samples. Arrhenius plots of sintered pellets revealed that the ordered spinels were shown to have two orders of magnitude lower electronic conductivity than disordered samples. The difference in electronic conductivity was assigned to the presence of a small amount of Mn3+ in disordered samples.},

  abstract = {We present the mechanism and the extent of increase in the oxygen anion diffusivity in Y(2)O(3) stabilized ZrO(2) (YSZ) under biaxial lattice strain. The oxygen vacancy migration paths and barriers in YSZ as a function of lattice strain was assessed computationally using density functional theory (DFT) and nudged elastic band (NEB) method. Two competing and non-linear processes acting in parallel were identified to alter the migration barrier upon applied strain: (1) the change in the space, or electronic density, along the migration path, and (2) the change in the strength of the interatomic bonds between the migrating oxygen and the nearest neighbor cations that keep the oxygen from migrating. The increase of the migration space and the weakening of the local oxygen-cation bonds correspond to a decrease of the migration barrier, and vice versa. The contribution of the bond strength to the changes in the migration barrier is more significant than that of the opening of migration space in strained YSZ. A database of migration barrier energies as a function of lattice strain for a set of representative defect distributions in the vicinity of the migration path in YSZ was constructed. This database was used in kinetic Monte Carlo (KMC) simulations to estimate the effective oxygen diffusivity in strained YSZ. The oxygen diffusivity exhibits an exponential increase up to a critical value of tensile strain, or the fastest strain. This increase is more significant at the lower temperatures. At the strain states higher than the critical strain, the diffusivity decreases. This is attributed to the local relaxations at large strain states beyond a limit of elastic bond strain, resulting in the strengthening of the local oxygen-cation bonds that increases the migration barrier. The highest enhancement of diffusivity in 9\%-YSZ compared to its unstrained state is 6.8 x 10(3) times at 4\% strain and at 400 K. The results indicate that inducing an optimal strain state by direct mechanical load or by creating a coherent hetero-interface with lattice mismatch can enable desirably high ionic conductivity in YSZ at reduced temperatures. The insights gained here particularly on the nonlinear and competing consequences of lattice strain on the local bonding structure and charge transport process are of importance for tuning the ionic transport properties in a variety of solid-state conducting material applications, including but not limited to fuel cells.},

Machine learning approaches are effective in reducing the complexity of data and rapidly homing in on the underlying trend in multi-dimensional data. Here, we show that by employing an algorithm called the mean shift theory to a large amount of diffraction data in high-throughput experimentation, one can streamline the process of delineating the structural evolution across compositional variations mapped on combinatorial libraries with minimal computational cost. Data collected at a synchrotron beamline are analyzed on the fly, and by integrating experimental data with the inorganic crystal structure database (ICSD), we can substantially enhance the accuracy in classifying the structural phases across ternary phase spaces. We have used this approach to identify a novel magnetic phase with enhanced magnetic anisotropy which is a candidate for rare-earth free permanent magnet.},

However, further optimization of these materials requires a deeper understanding of the fundamental mechanisms underlying ultrafast ion conduction. To this end, we use ab initio molecular dynamics simulations and density-functional calculations to explore the motivations for cation diffusion. We find that superionic behavior in Li 2 B 12 H 12 and Na 2 B 12 H 12 results from a combination of key structural, chemical, and dynamical factors that introduce intrinsic frustration and disorder. A statistical metric is used to show that the structures exhibit a high density of accessible interstitial sites and site types, which correlates with the flatness of the energy landscape and the observed cation mobility. Furthermore, cations are found to dock to specific anion sites, leading to a competition between the geometric symmetry of the anion and the symmetry of the lattice itself, which can facilitate cation hopping. Finally, facile anion reorientations and other low-frequency thermal vibrations lead to fluctuations in the local potential that enhance cation mobility by creating a local driving force for hopping. We discuss the relevance of each factor for developing new ionic conductivity descriptors that can be used for discovery and optimization of closo-borate solid electrolytes, as well as superionic conductors more generally.},

While recent published works identify the lithium superoxide as the main degrading agent for propylene carbonate (PC), there is no clear experimental evidence that the oxygen at the cathode interface layer does not reduce further to peroxide before reacting with PC. Here, we investigate the reactivity of lithium peroxide versus propylene carbonate and find that Li(2)O(2) irreversibly decomposes the carbonate solvent, leading to alkyl carbonates. We also show that, compared with a single Li(2)O(2) unit in PC, a crystalline surface of Li(2)O(2) exhibits an enhanced reactivity. Our findings support the possibility that in lithium/air cells, oxygen may still be reduced to peroxide, with the formation of solid Li(2)O(2), which degrades by decomposing PC.},

  abstract = {The local-density and generalized gradient approximations LDA and GGA to density functional theory DFT exhibit incomplete error cancellation when energy differences are taken between chemically dissimilar systems. This energy inconsistency is manifested, e.g., in the tendency to underestimate the heat enthalpy of formation of semiconducting and insulating compounds in LDA and, even more so, in GGA. Considering a set of 61 compounds that can be formed from 14 elements cations: Cu, Mg, Ca, Zn, Cd, Al, Ga, and In; anions: N, P,As, O, S, and Se, optimized elemental reference energies are determined by least-squares error minimization of an overdetermined set of linear equations. These elemental energies are ``optimally consistent'' with the DFT energies of the semiconductor compounds and imply corrections of up to 1 eV compared to the respective LDA or GGA energies. While these ``corrections'' are not to be understood to yield the correct absolute total energies of the elements, they are proposed to give appropriate bounds for the chemical potentials for thermodynamic processes in semiconductors and insulators, such as, e.g., defect formation, surface reconstruction, or catalytic processes. The present model allows to evaluate thermodynamic processes using DFT energy differences taken only between systems that are expected to show good error cancellation.},

Of the superhard metals, the highest boride of tungsten\textemdash often referred to as WB               4               and sometimes as W               1\textendash x               B               3               \textemdash is one of the most promising candidates. The structure of this boride, however, has never been fully resolved, despite the fact that it was discovered in 1961\textemdash a fact that severely limits our understanding of its structure\textendash property relationships and has generated increasing controversy in the literature. Here, we present a new crystallographic model of this compound based on refinement against time-of-flight neutron diffraction data. Contrary to previous X-ray\textendash only structural refinements, there is strong evidence for the presence of interstitial arrangements of boron atoms and polyhedral bonding. The formation of these polyhedra\textemdash slightly distorted boron cuboctahedra\textemdash appears to be dependent upon the defective nature of the tungsten-deficient metal sublattice.

A combination of first principles computation, electrochemical and synchrotron characterizations is conducted to elucidate the working mechanism for the improved electrochemical properties. The reversible phase transformation from P2 to O2 is observed. New configurations of Na-ions and vacancy are found at x = 1/3 and 1/2, which correspond to the intermediate phases upon the electrochemical cycling process. The mobility of Na-ions is investigated using the galvanostatic intermittent titration technique (GITT) and the Na diffusion barriers are calculated by the Nudged Elastic Band (NEB) method. Both techniques prove that the mobility of Na-ions is faster than Li-ions in the O3 structure within the 1/3 \textbackslash textless x \textbackslash textless 2/3 concentration region. Excellent cycling properties and high rate capability can be obtained by limiting the oxygen framework shift during P2-O2 phase transformation, suggesting that this material can be a strong candidate as a sustainable low-cost Na-ion battery cathode.},

As a consequence, electrical conductivity and the electronic contribution to the thermal conductivity are typically proportional to each other. Lee et al. found a large violation of this so-called Wiedemann-Franz law near the insulator-metal transition in VO2 nanobeams. In the metallic phase, the electronic contribution to thermal conductivity was much smaller than what would be expected from the Wiedemann-Franz law. The results can be explained in terms of independent propagation of charge and heat in a strongly correlated system. Science, this issue p. 371 In electrically conductive solids, the Wiedemann-Franz law requires the electronic contribution to thermal conductivity to be proportional to electrical conductivity. Violations of the Wiedemann-Franz law are typically an indication of unconventional quasiparticle dynamics, such as inelastic scattering, or hydrodynamic collective motion of charge carriers, typically pronounced only at cryogenic temperatures. We report an order-of-magnitude breakdown of the Wiedemann-Franz law at high temperatures ranging from 240 to 340 kelvin in metallic vanadium dioxide in the vicinity of its metal-insulator transition. Different from previously established mechanisms, the unusually low electronic thermal conductivity is a signature of the absence of quasiparticles in a strongly correlated electron fluid where heat and charge diffuse independently. Charge and heat transport decouple in a strongly correlated electron system. Charge and heat transport decouple in a strongly correlated electron system.},

The potential also describes bulk properties of non-equilibrium structures (fcc and bcc) of indium in good agreement with first-principles calculations. Because the potential formalism is exactly the same as other previously developed MEAM potentials for a wide range of elements, it can be easily extended to multi-component systems such as In\textendash N, In\textendash As, Ga\textendash In and Ga\textendash In\textendash N.},

When the Kohn-Sham band-gap by GGA (PBE) or modified Becke-Johnson (mBJ) is used as a single predictor, OLSR model predicts the G0W0 band-gap of a randomly selected test data with the root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.54 eV. When Kohn-Sham band gap by PBE and mBJ methods are used together with a set of various forms of predictors representing constituent elements and crystal structures, RMSE decreases significantly. The best model by SVR yields the RMSE of 0.18 eV. A large set of band-gaps estimated in this way should be useful as predictors for materials exploration.}

The doped Li occupies empty octahedral interstitials (16c site) before the ordering transition, and can move to normal octahedral sites (16d (4b) site) after the transition. This movement strongly affects the Ni/Mn ordering transition because Li at 16c sites blocks the ordering transition pathway and Li at 16d (4b) sites affects electrostatic interactions with transition metals. As a result, Li doping increases in the Ni/Mn disordering without the effect of Mn3+ ions even though the Li-doped LNMO undergoes order-disorder transition at 700 \textdegree C. Li doping can control the amount of Ni/Mn disordering in the spinel without the negative effect of Mn3+ ions on the electrochemical property.},

By employing descriptors based simply on the chemical formula and using a training set of only 300 compounds, mean absolute errors of less than 0.04 meV/K/atom (15 meV/atom) are achieved for \$S\_\{vib\}\$ (\$F\_\{vib\}\$), whose values are distributed within a range of 0.9 meV/K/atom (300 meV/atom.) In addition, for training sets containing fewer than 2,000 compounds the chemical formula alone is shown to perform as well as, if not better than, four other more complex descriptors previously used in the literature.

  abstract = {Two-dimensional (2D) hexagonal boron nitride materials are isomorphs of carbon nanomaterials and hold promise for electronics applications owing to their unique properties. Despite the recent advances in synthesis, the current production capacity for boron nitride (BN) nanostructures is far behind that for carbon-based nanostructures. Understanding the growth mechanism of BN nanostructures through modeling and experiments is key to improving this situation. In the current work, we present the development of a ReaxFF-based force field capable of modeling the gasphase chemistry important for the chemical vapor deposition (CVD) synthesis process. This force field is parameterized to model the boron nitride nanostructure (BNNS) formation in the gas phase using BN and HBNH as precursors. Our ReaxFF simulations show that BN is the best of these two precursors in terms of quality and the size of BNNSs. The BN precursors lead to the formation of closed BNNSs. However, BNNSs are replaced with complex polymeric structures at temperatures of 2500 K and higher due to entropic effects. Compared to the BN precursors, the HBNH precursors form relatively small, flat, and low-quality BNNSs, but this structure is less affected by temperature. Additives like H2 significantly affect the BNNS formation by preventing closed BNNS formation. Our results show the ReaxFF capability in predicting the BN gas-phase chemistry and BNNS formation, thus providing key insights for experimental synthesis.},

  abstract = {Effect of the addition of MgO, along with Li2O, as sintering aid on the densification and ionic conductivity of Li-analogues of Nasicon has been studied. For this purpose, a series of compounds, LiGe2(PO4)3 (LGP) + x(MgO) + y(Li2O), x = y = 0\textendash 0.7; x = 0.2, 0.5 and y=0; x = 0 and y = 0.2, 0.5 and Li1.4[Ge1.6Al0.4](PO4)3 (LAGP) + x(MgO) + x(Li2O), x = 0\textendash 0.3, have been synthesized and characterized by powder X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), density, porosity and microstructure (by scanning electron microscope, SEM) of the sintered pellets. Results show that the additives do not get incorporated in to the crystal lattice of the Nasicon but act as a binder and drastically reduce the porosity of the pellets and improve connectivity between the grains. Binder addition enhances the ionic conductivity (rionic: bulk, rB and total, rT) at any given temperature in the LGP series and the rT reaches 1.210 4 S cm 1 at 100 jC in LGP 5, which is three orders of magnitude higher than that shown by LGP 0 at the same temperature. Similar enhancement of rB is also seen. However, the respective energies of activation, Ea(T) and Ea(B) behave differently with the binder addition. The LAGP series also show an enhancement of rT with the binder addition, by a factor of two and the Ea(T) remains almost unchanged. Present study shows that MgO acts as a binder and helps in reducing the porosity and improving the rionic of the Li-Nasicon phases.},

Our simulations find a stable structure for Li7P3S11 that is in approximate agreement with X-ray and neutron diffraction experiments. The calculated formation energy predicts the structure to be unstable with respect to decomposition into Li3PS4 and Li4P2S6 plus excess S which has been observed experimentally under certain preparation conditions. The minimum activation energy for Li ion migration is estimated to EA = 0.15 eV for a vacancy mechanism, a result which approximates the value of EA = 0.12 eV determined from temperature-dependent conductivity measurements.Within the accuracy of the calculations, some vacancy-interstitial pair formation energies are found to be Ef {$\approx$} 0. These low energy vacancy-interstitial pair formation processes contribute to the ``superionic'' properties of this material. For comparison, simulations on hypothetical phosphate and phosphonitride materials with similar crystal structures are presented and the results are analyzed in terms of possible connections to LiPON electrolytes.},

The simulations show that for some forms of Li3PS4, Li ions can move from a host lattice site to an interstitial site with negligible net energy change. This favorable process for the formation of vacancy-interstitial pairs is undoubtedly important for the structural and ion migration properties of {$\beta$}-Li3PS4. Our model results for the idealized interfaces between the electrolytes and Li metal show that Li3PO4 /Li interfaces are stable, while Li3PS4 /Li interfaces are not. We find that a Li3PS4 surface in the presence of a small amount of Li relaxes to a complicated structure involving broken P-S bonds. On the other hand, the computer models show that a very thin film of Li2S on the Li3PS4 surface can provide a protective buffer layer to stabilize the interface between the Li3PS4 electrolytes and the Li metal anode.},

Our investigation is motivated by experimental studies of the diffusion of alkali atoms on clean and contaminated (e.g. by oxygen atoms) single crystal metal and semiconductor surfaces. Concentration profiles of the diffusion fronts are in qualitative agreement with the experimental findings. Comparing to the behavior of non-interacting particles, it is found that dipolar repulsion considerably enhance the chemical diffusion coefficient, particularly at lower coverages where a sharp peak is observed close to theta approximate to 0.09. In contrast, the chemical diffusion coefficient of non-interacting particles exhibits a smooth maximum close to theta similar or equal to 0.5. The presence of random dipolar impurities causes a delay of the diffusion process and the low coverage peak of the diffusion coefficient becomes shifted to theta approximate to 0.16. The number of distinct sites visited by the diffusing particles, which is relevant for the evaluation of the rate constant for diffusion-limited reactions, is also studied and the results are compared with those of non-interacting particles.

We consider liquid ethylene carbonate (EC) decomposition on lithium intercalated graphite, lithium metal, oxide-coated graphite, and spinel manganese oxide surfaces. These calculations are put in the context of more widely studied water-solid interfaces. Our main themes include kinetically controlled two-electron-induced reactions, the breaking of a previously much neglected chemical bond in EC, and electron tunneling.

In this work, the "anode potential" of charge-neutral lithium-intercalated graphite (LiC6) with oxidized edge planes is computed as a function of Li-content (nLi) at edge planes, using ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD), a previously introduced Li(+) transfer free energy method, and the experimental Li(+)/Li(s) value as reference. The voltage assignments are corroborated using explicit electron transfer from fluoroethylene carbonate radical anion markers. PF6(-) is shown to decompose electrochemically (i.e., not just thermally) at low potentials imposed by our voltage calibration technique. We demonstrate that excess electrons reside in localized states-in-the-gap in the organic carbonate liquid region, which is not semiconductor-like (band-state-like) as widely assumed in the literature.},

The data were treated within the framework of a simple model expressed by a Frumkin-type sorption isotherm. The experimental SSCV curves were well described by an equation combining such an isotherm with the Butler-Volmer equation for slow interfacial Li-ion transfer. The apparent attraction constant was 24.2, which is characteristic of a quasi-equilibrium, first-order phase transition. Impedance spectra reflected a process with the following steps: Li1 ion migration in solution, Li1 ion migration through surface films, strongly potential-dependent charge-transfer resistance, solid-state Li1 diffusion, and accumulation of the intercalants into the host materials. An excellent fit was found between these spectra and an equivalent circuit, including a Voigt-type analog (Li1 migration through multilayer surface films and charge transfer) in series with a finite-length Warburg-type element (Li1 solid-state diffusion), and a capacitor (Li accumulation). In this paper, we compare the solid-state diffusion time constants and the differential intercalation capacities obtained by the three electroanalytical techniques.},

  abstract = {A series of electrochemical capacitors, based on activated carbon powders (ACP, specific surface area 870 and 2600 m(2)/g) and ionic liquids as electrolytes, were prepared and tested. The ionic liquids consisted of 1-ethyl-3-methyl imidazolium (EMIm(+)), 1-butyl-3-methyl imidazolium (BMIm(+)) and 1-methyl-1-propyl pyrrolidinium (BMPy+) cations, as well as of tetrafluoroborate, hexafluorophosphate and bis((trifluoromethyl)sulfonyl) imide anions. A typical capacitor consisted of two electrodes each with a mass of ca. 15-30 mg, and showed a capacity of ca. 0.35-1.5 F; this leads to a specific capacity of the carbon electrode material within the range of 45 (ACP 870 m(2)/g)-180 F/g (ACP 2600 m(2)/g). The specific capacity expressed versus total surface of carbon material was within the range of 5.2-6.9 muF/cm(2). The electrochemical stability window of ionic liquids determined at the glassy carbon electrode is within the range of ca. 3.0-4.2 V. The energy stored in a capacitor based on activated carbons and ionic liquids may be high, due to a broad practical electrochemical stability window of ca. 3 V. Ionic liquids are characterised by negligible vapour pressure; such a capacitor emits no volatile organic compounds and may be regarded as environmentally friendly. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

Despite extensive research, the development of an efficient and near-infrared (NIR) 5d-to-4f emission remains elusive. Herein, we introduce key descriptors of the Eu(II)-host interactions and predict the in-crystal 5d-to-4f energy gap with a root-mean-square error of ca. 0.03 eV (7.0 nm). By incorporating this luminescence predictor into a high-throughput screening of 223 nitride materials in the Inorganic Crystal Structure Database, we identify and experimentally validate (Sr,Ba)3Li4Si2N6:Eu(II) with NIR emissions of {$\lambda$}em = 800 {$\sim$} 830 nm and high quantum efficiencies (QEs) of 30\% {$\sim$} 40\%, leading to an NIR light power {$\sim$}3\texttimes{} superior to prevailing NIR emitters. The ultralong {$\lambda$}em and high QE stem from a coordinated energy transfer and an optimized electronic delocalization around Eu(II). This work provides a cost-efficient computational approach for discovering phosphors with desired emissions.},

However, their electrically insulating nature plagues effi cient charge transport within the electroactive bulk. Alternative to the popular solution of elaborating nanocomposite materials, herein we report on a molecular-level engineering strategy towards high-power organic electrode materials with multi-electron reactions. Systematic comparisons of anthraquinone analogues incorporating fused heteroaromatic structures as cathode materials in rechargeable lithium batteries reveal that the judicious incorporation of heteroaromatics improves the cell performance in terms of specifi c gravimetric capacity, working potential, rate capability, and cyclability. Combination studies with morphological observation, electrochemical impedance characterization, and theoretical modeling provide insight into the advantage of heteroaromatic building blocks. In particular, benzofuro[5,6- b ]furan-4,8-dione ( BFFD ) bearing furan moeities shows a reversible capacity of 181 mAh g - 1 when charged/discharged at 100C, corresponding to a power density of 29.8 kW kg - 1 . These results have pointed to a general design route of high-rate organic electrode materials by rational functionalization of redox compounds with appropriate heteroaromatic units as versatile structural tools.},

  abstract = {Aqueous rechargeable batteries provide the safety, robustness, aaordability, and environmental friendliness necessary for grid storage and electric vehicle operations, but their adoption is plagued by poor cycle life due to the structural and chemical instability of the anode materials. Here we report quinones as stable anode materials by exploiting their structurally stable ion-coordination charge storage mechanism and chemical inertness towards aqueous electrolytes. Upon rational selection/design of quinone structures, we demonstrate three systems that coupled with industrially established cathodes and electrolytes exhibit long cycle life (up to 3,000 cycles/3,500 h), fast kinetics ({$\geq$}20C), high anode specific capacity (up to 200\textendash 395 mAh g -1), and several examples of state-of-the-art specific energy/energy density (up to 76\textendash 92 Wh kg -1 / 161\textendash 208 Wh l -1) for several operational pH values (-1 to 15), charge carrier species (H + , Li + , Na + , K + , Mg 2+), temperature (-35 to 25 \textbullet{} C), and atmosphere (with/without O 2), making them a universal anode approach for any aqueous battery technology. T he increasing demand for integration of electricity generated from renewable energies into the grid and electrification of transportation vehicles call for batteries that are envi-ronmentally friendly, safe, inexpensive, and long lasting 1,2 . Aque-ous rechargeable batteries 3\textendash 6 featuring low-cost and nonflammable water-based electrolytes are intrinsically safe and do not rely heav-ily on the protection from complex battery management systems, thereby providing robustness and cost advantages over competing lithium-ion batteries that use volatile organic electrolytes and are responsible for recent catastrophic explosions. However, state-of-the-art aqueous rechargeable batteries show short cycle life 7 and fall short of meeting large-scale applications where frequent replace-ment of batteries is undesirable. The anode materials have been the cycle-life-limiting component for most, if not all, aqueous rechargeable batteries 8\textendash 10 . For example, lead-based acidic batteries are inexpensive and reliable but have poor cycle life (200 cycles for deep cycling 7) due to the premature ageing of the lead (Pb) anode into a thick PbSO 4 passivation layer 8 . No other faradaic electrode material has been discovered to work as anode for acid batteries. Recent efforts to substitute Pb with non-faradaic activated carbon (AC) extend cycle life at the cost of {$\sim$}60\% reduction in specific energy 11\textendash 13 . Another established family of aqueous rechargeable batteries are nickel-based alkaline batteries, including nickel\textendash iron, nickel\textendash cadmium, nickel\textendash zinc, and nickel\textendash{} metal hydride (MmH) batteries, which consist of the same nickel hydroxide (Ni(OH) 2) cathode but varying anodes 10,14 . However, iron, cadmium, and zinc anodes undergo dissolution\textendash precipitation, while MmH volume expansion\textendash contraction during battery charge\textendash{} discharge cycling negatively impacts cycle life. The comparatively most stable MmH is made of rare earth metals and the expensive cobalt, with the latter accounting for one-half of the total material cost for a nickel\textendash MmH battery 15 . The emerging aqueous lithium-ion batteries (ALIBs) use less corrosive, near-neutral electrolytes and store charge via an ion intercalation mechanism where the structure of the electrode material does not alter significantly 16\textendash 19 . Therefore, ALIBs could achieve a much longer cycle life than those of their commercial acidic and alkaline siblings. However, the only two practical anodes for ALIBs, lithium metal phosphates 9,20 and polyimides 21,22 , are unstable to oxygen and alkalis, respectively, severely restricting applications. Finally, recent developments of aqueous sodium-ion batteries highlight the use of low-cost and highly stable AC and Prussian Blue anodes; however, both approaches exhibit very low capacities ({$\sim$}50 mAh g -1) (refs 23,24). With the lack of anode materials meeting all requirements, the application of aqueous rechargeable batteries for large-scale energy storage has been stagnant. The major challenges for aqueous anodes lie in the search for materials that are chemically robust towards aqueous electrolytes, easily accessible and inexpensive, have high specific capacity, store charge via a structurally reversible/stable mechanism, and fit in the electrochemical stability window of the electrolyte solvent, thus water. Quinones, of which the most common motif comprises the 1,2-benzoquinone or 1,4-benzoquinone units (Fig. 1), have been considered for nonaqueous metal-ion batteries and aqueous flow batteries 25\textendash 30 . These compounds store charge via an 'ion-coordination' mechanism where the cations coordinate to the neg-atively charged oxygen atoms upon electrochemical reduction of the carbonyl groups, and uncoordinate reversibly during the reverse oxidation (Fig. 1; not to be confused with quinone derivatives where the carbonyls are converted to redox-inactive groups 31). Properly functionalized quinones have shown excellent chemical stability 30 and their reduction potentials can be readily tuned from 1.7 to 3.2 V versus Li upon molecular engineering 27 . Despite these advantages, there are only very few pioneering reports on their use in aqueous batteries.

However, its poor electrical conductivity limits its practical application.

Within three years, the reversible capacity of Li3VO4 increased from 320 to 590 mA h g-1, its capacity can be remained at 230 mA h g-1 even at a high current density of 125 C (50 A g-1), long cycle life of 5000 cycles at 50 C (20 A g-1) with little capacity decay is also achieved. Simultaneously, the in-depth study by in-situ and ex-situ XRD push forward for the better understanding of Li3VO4 on its insertion mechanism and structure evolution processes.

  abstract = {Although great efforts have been made in investigating layered metal oxides for high-energy rocking-chair batteries, the capacities of conventional materials have reached the bottlenecks of theoretical values, which are critically dependent on the ability to (de)intercalate the single cation. In this work, we demonstrate a proof of concept, i.e., both cationic and anionic co-(de)intercalation into a typical layered oxide, which is firstly investigated in a P3-Na0.5Ni0.25Mn0.75O2. During the electrochemical process, the energy storage is not only provided by the conventional cationic (Na+) (de)intercalation with the charge compensation of cationic (Ni2+{$\leftrightarrow$}Ni4+) reversible redox, but also achieved by the release and uptake of anions (ClO4-) accompanied by an anionic (O2-{$\leftrightarrow$}O-) reversible redox. Furthermore, the results show that the anion-participating electrochemical process is a fast-kinetics process, and the feasibility of this mechanism could extend to various anions. Conventional rocking-chair batteries, such as alkali metal-ion batteries, operate by shuttling a single type of cation (Li+, Na+, K+, etc.) between two intercalating electrodes during charge and discharge processes, thus the capacity is critically limited by the ability to (de)intercalate these cations. Here, we report a synergetic (de)intercalation of cation and anion in a typical layered cathode, demonstrating a proof of concept beyond the theoretical capacity for conventional cathodes. Results reveal that the anions can be reversibly inserted/extracted into layered structures followed by a Na-ion extraction/insertion, both of which unambiguously improve the energy performance. Our findings highlight new intercalation chemistry for typical layered materials, and moreover open up new opportunities for designing high-energy cathode materials in sodium storage. Both cationic and anionic co-(de)intercalation have been proposed in a layered metal-oxide cathode and demonstrate a proof of concept beyond the theoretical capacity for conventional metal oxides with only cationic (de)intercalation. Our findings enrich the new intercalation and redox chemistry and could extend to other electrodes for further large-scale energy storage.},

Here we elucidate the complex interplay between segregation, short-range order, and strengthening in the NbMoTaW MPEA through atomistic simulations with a highly accurate machine learning interatomic potential. In the single crystal MPEA, we find greatly reduced anisotropy in the critically resolved shear stress between screw and edge dislocations compared to the elemental metals. In the polycrystalline MPEA, we demonstrate that thermodynamically driven Nb segregation to the grain boundaries (GBs) and W enrichment within the grains intensifies the observed short-range order (SRO). The increased GB stability due to Nb enrichment reduces the von Mises strain, resulting in higher strength than a random solid solution MPEA. These results highlight the need to simultaneously tune GB composition and bulk SRO to tailor the mechanical properties of MPEAs.},

In this work, we report the discovery of the first-known Eu2+-activated full-visible-spectrum phosphor, Sr2AlSi2O6N:Eu2+, identified by combining data mining of high-throughput density functional theory calculations and experimental characterization. Excited by UV-light-emitting diodes (LEDs), Sr2AlSi2O6N:Eu2+ shows a superbroad emission with a bandwidth of 230 nm, the broadest emission bandwidth ever reported, and has excellent thermal quenching resistance (88\% intensity at 150 \textdegree C). A prototype white LED utilizing only this full-visible-spectrum phosphor exhibits superior color quality (Ra = 97, R9 = 91), outperforming commercial tricolor phosphor-converted LEDs. These findings not only show great promise of Sr2AlSi2O6N:Eu2+ as a single white emitter but also open up in silico design of full-visible-spectra phosphor in a single-phase material to address the reabsorption energy loss in commercial tricolor phosphor mixture.},

  abstract = {In this Perspective, we review the recent work on metal halide perovskite light-emitting devices (peLEDs) with a focus on current challenges and the prospect of commercialization of perovskite displays. Metal halide perovskites have shown remarkable hole and electron mobilities, high photoluminescence quantum yield and color tunability, and thin line width emission peaks making them ideal materials for the emissive layer in LEDs. Red- and green-emitting perovskites have already achieved very high external quantum efficiencies of greater than 20\% in the last year and may be ready to begin the commercialization process. However, blue peLEDs still lag behind in efficiency and stability. After reviewing recent attempts to improve the blue peLED efficiency, we then list the current challenges in the field and suggest possible avenues of future research, including improvements in materials chemistry and device architecture. In particular, we find that advancements are needed in color stability and lifetime, by using doping and nanostructured materials to avoid ion migration effects, and in the synthesis of novel compounds. We then compare the current state of the art in peLEDs with the competitive landscape and conclude that fixing the blue peLEDs is the key to building micropixel LEDs from perovskites. Without blue-emitting perovskites, high PLQY perovskite films can still be useful for down-conversion color filters but may have difficulty displacing existing technologies. Thus, for perovskites, the future is indeed blue (LEDs).},

However, the poor stability and toxicity of lead halide perovskites severely limit their large-scale applications. Here we show a high-throughput design of lead-free hybrid halide semiconductors with robust materials stability and desired material properties beyond perovskites. On the basis of 24 prototype structures that include perovskite and non-perovskite structures and several typical organic cations, a comprehensive quantum materials repository that contains 4507 hypothetical hybrid compounds was built using large-scale first-principles calculations. After a high-throughput screening of this repository, we have rapidly identified 23 candidates for light-emitting diodes and 13 candidates for solar energy conversion.

  abstract = {The elastic deformation behaviors of perfect NiAl and FeAl are investigated using an ab initio electronic structure total energy method. The calculated ideal shear strengths for the \{112\}111 and \{110\}111 slip show qualitatively different features between the two intermetallics. In NiAl, the shear deformation can be understood by exploring the transition among different stress-free structures on the strain paths, while in FeAl the instabilities under shear are found to be dictated by filling of the unstable anti-bonding d states. The failure modes under uniaxial 100 tension are also explored for NiAl and FeAl using two methods, a straightforward comparison of the resolved shear stress with the ideal shear strength and a detailed examination of the internal stability condition. Both methods yield the same conclusion: FeAl fails by tension while NiAl fails by shear. These predictions are consistent with the experimentally observed cleavage behaviors. \textcopyright{} 2006 The American Physical Society.}

The morphologies of the samples were examined by fi eld-emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM, Hitachi S-4800) and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM, JEOL JEM-3000F). For Ex-situ XRD measurements, the electrode was picked from a freshly charge/ discharged coin-type cell and sealed with Mylar fi lm in an argon-fi lled glove box, and then immediately performed the XRD measurement. The electrochemical performances were measured with coin-type cells which coupled a Li3VO4 composite electrode and a Li metal electrode. The Li3VO4 composite electrode was made by 75\% of Li3VO4 , 20\% of conducting agent and 5\% of binder in weight.

  abstract = {As a generic property, all substances transfer heat through microscopic collisions of constituent particles 1 . A solid con-ducts heat through both transverse and longitudinal acoustic phonons, but a liquid employs only longitudinal vibrations 2,3 . As a result, a solid is usually thermally more conductive than a liquid. In canonical viewpoints, such a difference also serves as the dynamic signature distinguishing a solid from a liq-uid. Here, we report liquid-like thermal conduction observed in the crystalline AgCrSe 2 . The transverse acoustic phonons are completely suppressed by the ultrafast dynamic disorder while the longitudinal acoustic phonons are strongly scat-tered but survive, and are thus responsible for the intrinsically ultralow thermal conductivity. This scenario is applicable to a wide variety of layered compounds with heavy intercalants in the van der Waals gaps, manifesting a broad implication on suppressing thermal conduction. These microscopic insights might reshape the fundamental understanding on thermal transport properties of matter and open up a general opportu-nity to optimize performances of thermoelectrics. Thermal transport is one of the most fundamental proper-ties of matter 1 . As a persistent challenge, rationalizing anomalous thermal transport properties has been reforming our understand-ing on solid materials, such as the birth of phonon glasses 4\textendash 6 and the observation of wave\textendash particle duality of phonon transport in superlattices 7 . Meanwhile, materials with small thermal conductiv-ity are desirable for a great diversity of applications such as thermal insulation 8 , optical phase-change memory devices 9 and efficient thermoelectric energy conversion 10 . Therefore, it is of both funda-mental significance and technological interest to explore suppressed thermal transport in solids. By conducting a comprehensive study combining state-of-the-art neutron/X-ray scattering with density-functional-perturbation-theory (DFPT) calculations on the chal-cogenide AgCrSe 2 , we found that the low-lying intense transverse acoustic (TA) phonons that are exclusively dominated by motions of Ag atoms compete with fluctuations inherent in the order-to-disor-der transition of Ag occupation. Phonons are significantly damped as temperature rises. Above the transition temperature, transverse vibrations of Ag atoms are suppressed by the ultrafast atomic fluctu-ations while the longitudinal acoustic (LA) mode remains, charac-teristic of liquid-like thermal conduction with extremely low lattice thermal conductivity},

However, the limited knowledge of the complex polymorphism of VOPO4 and LiVOPO4 prevents any systematic optimization. Here we present a comprehensive first-principles study on the phase stability of VOPO4 and LiVOPO4 and its impact on the electrochemical properties. bVOPO4 and aLiVOPO4 are predicted to be the most stable phases of VOPO4 and LiVOPO4, respectively. The crucial factor that determines the phase stability is the connection between cation polyhedra including the tilting of VO6 octahedra and the distance between cations, but not the bonding between cations and anions. The calculated data well explain the experimentally observed transition from the aII- to the aI-phase and from the 3- to the a-phase induced by lithiation. The transition from the b- to the a-phase is also possible but is associated with much larger structural deformation. The voltages calculated using possible phase transitions taken into account are in excellent agreement with experimental measurements. The diffusivity in bLiVOPO4 and aLiVOPO4 differs by five orders of magnitude at 300 K. These results elucidate the importance of the phase stability of VOPO4 and LiVOPO4 in the application of Li-ion battery cathodes and pave the way for their future improvements.},

Developing capture materials and processes that reduce the parasitic energy imposed by CCS is therefore an important area of research. We have developed a computational approach to rank adsorbents for their performance in CCS. Using this analysis, we have screened hundreds of thousands of zeolite and zeolitic imidazolate framework structures and identified many different structures that have the potential to reduce the parasitic energy of CCS by 30-40\% compared with near-term technologies.},

These are primarily responsible for the prevailing capacity fading and impedance buildup under high-voltage cycling conditions, as well as the first-cycle coulombic inefficiency. It was found that the surface reconstruction exhibits a strong anisotropic characteristic, which predominantly occurs along lithium diffusion channels. Furthermore, the surface reaction layer is composed of lithium fluoride embedded in a complex organic matrix. This work sets a refined example for the study of surface reconstruction and chemical evolution in battery materials using combined diagnostic tools at complementary length scales.},

  abstract = {The environmental and economic benefits of phosphor-converted white-light-emitting diodes (pc-WLEDs) have been increasingly appreciated in recent years. However, a significant challenge in this field pertains to a phenomenon known as thermal quenching, which takes place inside phosphors and leads to a pronounced reduction of the emission intensity under high-power light-emitting diode operation. The development of new, more thermally stable phosphors depends on a better understanding of the mechanisms underpinning thermal quenching in phosphors. Here we review the current understanding of thermal quenching mechanisms in Ce3+-doped garnet phosphors, which are widely considered one of the most important families of phosphors for application in pc-WLEDs. In particular, we highlight key structural and dynamical properties, such as the coordination environment of the Ce3+ ions, phonons and local vibrational modes, and structural and chemical defects, which are shown to correlate with phosphor performance. We also discuss the perspectives for future studies in this field in hopes of accelerating the development of new efficient phosphors featuring suppressed thermal quenching of luminescence.},

This study elucidates the crystalline structure and lattice parameters of the products via a solid-state reaction, using powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) and GSAS refinement. The versatility of the phosphor host A(I)B(II)PO(4) is established by examining isovalent substitutions of four cations in the structure-Li or K for A(I), Sr or Ba for B(II)-and three doped activators, RE = Eu(2+), Tb(3+), and Sm(3+). The luminescence properties, decay time, and Commission Internationale de l'Eclairage (CIE) chromaticity index are determined for various concentrations of these activators and metal constituents of the host. The thermal stabilities of all of these compounds are determined for the first time from the crystal structure and the coordination environment of the rare-earth metal. The morphology, composition, and particle size were measured in detail. Finally, density functional calculations were performed using the generalized gradient approximation plus an on-site Coulombic interaction correction (GGA+U) scheme to investigate the electronic structures of the KSrPO(4) system. A concise model was proposed to explain the luminescence mechanism.},

  abstract = {Perovskite materials have become ubiquitous in many technologically relevant applications, ranging from catalysts in solid oxide fuel cells to light absorbing layers in solar photovoltaics. The thermodynamic phase stability is a key parameter that broadly governs whether the material is expected to be synthesizable, and whether it may degrade under certain operating conditions. Phase stability can be calculated using Density Functional Theory (DFT), but the significant computational cost makes such calculation potentially prohibitive when screening large numbers of possible compounds. In this work, we developed machine learning models to predict the thermodynamic phase stability of perovskite oxides using a dataset of more than 1900 DFT-calculated perovskite oxide energies. The phase stability was determined using convex hull analysis, with the energy above the convex hull (Ehull) providing a direct measure of the stability. We generated a set of 791 features based on elemental property data to correlate with the Ehullvalue of each perovskite compound, and found through feature selection that the top 70 features were sufficient to produce the most accurate models without significant overfitting. For classification, the extra trees algorithm achieved the best prediction accuracy of 0.93 ({$\pm$}0.02), with an F1score of 0.88 ({$\pm$}0.03). For regression, leave-out 20\% cross-validation tests with kernel ridge regression achieved the minimal root mean square error (RMSE) of 28.5 ({$\pm$}7.5) meV/atom between cross-validation predicted Ehullvalues and DFT calculations, with the mean absolute error (MAE) in cross-validation energies of 16.7 ({$\pm$}2.3) meV/atom. This error is within the range of errors in DFT formation energies relative to elemental reference states when compared to experiments and therefore may be considered sufficiently accurate to use in place of full DFT calculations. We further validated our model by predicting the stability of compounds not present in the training set and demonstrated our machine learning models are a fast and effective means of obtaining qualitatively useful guidance for a wide-range of perovskite oxide stability, potentially impacting materials design choices in a variety of technological applications.},

However, most such potential development efforts have largely focused on simple elemental systems. In this work, we generalize the spectral neighbor analysis potential (SNAP) model to bcc-fcc binary alloy systems. We demonstrate that machine-learned SNAP models can yield significant improvements even over well-established, high-performing embedded atom method (EAM) and modified EAM (MEAM) potentials for fcc Cu and Ni. We also report on the development of a SNAP model for the fcc Ni-bcc Mo binary system by machine learning a carefully-constructed large computed data set of elemental and intermetallic compounds. We demonstrate that this binary Ni-Mo SNAP model can achieve excellent agreement with experiments in the prediction of Ni-Mo phase diagram as well as near-DFT accuracy in the prediction of many key properties such as elastic constants, formation energies, melting points, etc., across the entire binary composition range. In contrast, the existing Ni-Mo EAM has significant errors in the prediction of the phase diagram and completely fails in binary compounds. This work provides a systematic model development process for multi-component systems, including an efficient procedure to optimize the hyper-parameters in the model fitting, and paves the way to long-time, large-scale simulations of non-elemental systems.},

In our experiments, we found that when the plating and stripping current density is raised above {$\sim$}9 milliamperes per square centimeter, there is substantial self-heating of the dendrites, which triggers extensive surface migration of Li. This surface diffusion heals the dendrites and smoothens the Li metal surface. We show that repeated doses of high-current-density healing treatment enables the safe cycling of Li-sulfur batteries with high coulombic efficiency.},

This material has a wide electrochemical window (5 V) and superior chemical stability against lithium metal. The nanoporous structure of Li3PS4 reconciles two vital effects that enhance the ionic conductivity: (1) the reduction of the dimensions to a nanometer-sized framework stabilizes the high-conduction {$\beta$} phase that occurs at elevated temperatures, and (2) the high surface-to-bulk ratio of nanoporous {$\beta$}-Li3PS4 promotes surface conduction.

However, the sub-optimal intercalation potentials of current anodes result in a trade-of between energy density, power and safety. Here we report that disordered rock salt Li3+xV2O5 can be used as a fast-charging anode that can reversibly cycle two lithium ions at an average voltage of about 0.6 volts versus a Li/Li+ reference electrode. The increased potential compared to graphite reduces the likelihood of lithium metal plating if proper charging controls are used, alleviating a major safety concern (short-circuiting related to Li dendrite growth). In addition, a lithium-ion battery with a disordered rock salt Li3V2O5 anode yields a cell voltage much higher than does a battery using a commercial fast-charging lithium titanate anode or other intercalation anode candidates (Li3VO4 and LiV0.5Ti0.5S2). Further, disordered rock salt Li3V2O5 can perform over 1,000 charge\textendash discharge cycles with negligible capacity decay and exhibits exceptional rate capability, delivering over 40 per cent of its capacity in 20 seconds. We attribute the low voltage and high rate capability of disordered rock salt Li3V2O5 to a redistributive lithium intercalation mechanism with low energy barriers revealed via ab initio calculations.

  abstract = {Many different photovoltaic technologies are being developed for large-scale solar energy conversion. The wafer-based first-generation photovoltaic devices have been followed by thin-film solid semiconductor absorber layers sandwiched between two charge-selective contacts and nanostructured (or mesostructured) solar cells that rely on a distributed heterojunction to generate charge and to transport positive and negative charges in spatially separated phases. Although many materials have been used in nanostructured devices, the goal of attaining high-efficiency thin-film solar cells in such a way has yet to be achieved. Organometal halide perovskites have recently emerged as a promising material for high-efficiency nanostructured devices. Here we show that nanostructuring is not necessary to achieve high efficiencies with this material: a simple planar heterojunction solar cell incorporating vapour-deposited perovskite as the absorbing layer can have solar-to-electrical power conversion efficiencies of over 15 per cent (as measured under simulated full sunlight). This demonstrates that perovskite absorbers can function at the highest efficiencies in simplified device architectures, without the need for complex nanostructures.},

It maintains a reversible capacity of 230 mAh g-1 , far exceeding the ``theoretical'' capacity of 175 mAh g-1 when this anode is lithiated to the composition Li7Ti5O12 . Neutron diffraction analyses identify that additional Li reversibly enters into the Li7Ti5O12 to form Li8Ti5O12. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal the average potentials of the Li4Ti5O12 to Li7Ti5O12 step and the Li7Ti5O12 to Li8Ti5O12 step are 1.57 and 0.19 V, respectively, which are in excellent agreement with experimental results. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) studies confirm that the irreversible capacity of Li4Ti5O12 during its first cycle originates from the formation of a solid electrolyte interface (SEI) layer. This work clarifies the fundamental lithiation mechanism of the Li4Ti5O12 , when lithiated to 0.01 V vs Li.},

  abstract = {It is demonstrated that Na ions are mobile at room temperature in the nitridophosphate compound Na3TiP3O9N, with a diffusion pathway that is calculated to be fully three-dimensional and isotropic. When used as a cathode in Na-ion batteries, Na3TiP3O9N has an average voltage of 2.7 V vs Na+/Na and cycles with good reversibility through a mechanism that appears to be a single solid solution process without any intermediate plateaus. X-ray and neutron diffraction studies as well as first-principles calculations indicate that the volume change that occurs on Na-ion removal is only about 0.5\%, a remarkably small volume change given the large ionic radius of Na+. Rietveld refinements indicate that the Na1 site is selectively depopulated during sodium removal. Furthermore, the refined displacement parameters support theoretical predictions that the lowest energy diffusion pathway incorporates the Na1 and Na3 sites while the Na2 site is relatively inaccessible. The measured room temperature ionic conductivity of Na3TiP3O9N is substantial (4 \texttimes{} 10-7 S/cm), though both the strong temperature dependence of Na-ion thermal parameters and the observed activation energy of 0.54 eV suggest that much higher ionic conductivities can be achieved with minimal heating. Excellent thermal stability is observed for both pristine Na3TiP3O9N and desodiated Na2TiP3O9N, suggesting that this phase can serve as a safe Na-ion battery electrode. Moreover, it is expected that further optimization of the general cubic framework of Na3TiP3O9N by chemical substitution will result in thermostable solid state electrolytes with isotropic conductivities that can function at temperatures near or just above room temperature.},

In hard condensed-matter problems, like phase transitions, charge-density waves or phasons in quasicrystals, the study of speckle fluctuations provides new time-resolved methods.

  abstract = {The cathodic limit of the electrochemical window in the second-generation ionic liquids (composed of air- and water-stable metal-free cations and anions) is traditionally believed to be determined by the reduction of the cation. More and more exceptions, however, were found in various ionic liquids. In this study, the cathodic limit of the electrochemical window in 1-butyl-1-methylpyrrolidinium salicylate ionic liquid (BMP-SAL IL) was studied. It has been found that the cathodic limit of BMP-SAL is determined by the reduction of SAL- anion rather than the reduction of BMP+ cation. The cyclic voltammetric behavior, NMR spectra, and MALDI-TOF MS spectra of BMP-SAL recorded before and after the IL was electrolyzed at the cathodic limit provide sufficient evidences that the major reaction at the cathodic limit of BMP-SAL is the reduction of SAL- anion. The theoretical calculations support the experimental data and the results indicate that anion reduction dominated cathodic limit should be a common phenomenon in ionic liquids.},

These samples were investigated by powder X-ray diffraction analysis, electron paramagnetic resonance and 59Fe M\"ossbauer spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy micrographs, and electrochemical lithium intercalation. The NASICON-type structure belongs to the R{$\overline 3$}c space group. Upon substitution of Ti4+, the c/a ratio and cell volume increased as a result of the higher ionic radii of Ca2+(1.14 \textbackslash AA), Fe2+ (0.92 \textbackslash AA), and Fe3+ (0.785 \textbackslash AA) compared to those for Ti4+ (0.745 \textbackslash AA). Although calcium is not electroactive versus lithium, the electrochemical Li insertion was significantly affected by the presence of calcium ions in the NASICON-type structure. The determination of oxidation state of titanium ions in Ca-substituted orthophosphates showed that tetrahedrally coordinated Ti3+ ions in the Li-rich end composition participate in the electrochemical reaction of intercalation of Li+ shifting the potential of reaction from 2.5 to 2.8 V in charge. The role of iron is elucidated with the use of 57Fe M\"ossbauer spectroscopy. The Fe2+ observed in the as-prepared electrode is completely oxidized to Fe3+ in the first charge. Successive discharge/charge of lithium test cells evidenced the involvement of the whole iron content in the reaction undergoing at 2.8 V. Stable capacities ranging between 126 and 131 mA{$\cdot$}h/ g after 100 cycles and about 120 mA{$\cdot$}h/g after 60 cycles are recorded for Li1.2+xTi1.9-xFexCa0.1(PO4)3 (x = 0.1-0.4) and Li1+2xTi2-xCax(PO4)3 based electrodes (x = 0.1-0.5), respectively.},

However, despite the growing importance of thermal management in micro- and nanoscale devices, a unified understanding of the atomic-scale structural features contributing to interfacial heat transport does not exist. Herein, we experimentally demonstrate a link between interfacial bonding character and thermal conductance at the atomic level. Our experimental system consists of a gold film transfer-printed to a self-assembled monolayer (SAM) with systematically varied termination chemistries. Using a combination of ultrafast pump-probe techniques (time-domain thermoreflectance, TDTR, and picosecond acoustics) and laser spallation experiments, we independently measure and correlate changes in bonding strength and heat flow at the gold-SAM interface. For example, we experimentally demonstrate that varying the density of covalent bonds within this single bonding layer modulates both interfacial stiffness and interfacial thermal conductance. We believe that this experimental system will enable future quantification of other interfacial phenomena and will be a critical tool to stimulate and validate new theories describing the mechanisms of interfacial heat transport. Ultimately, these findings will impact applications, including thermoelectric energy harvesting, microelectronics cooling, and spatial targeting for hyperthermal therapeutics.},

The electrodes exhibit small voltage hysteresis (c. a. 0.1 V at 30 mA g(-1)) and good capacity retention. Such superior electrochemical performance of TiNb2O7 makes it one of the most promising anode materials to replace spinel Li4Ti5O12 for applications in hybrid vehicles and large scale stationary Li-ion batteries. In addition, we demonstrate crystal structures of TiNb2O7 and lithiated TiNb2O7 using advanced spherical-aberration-corrected scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM), to picture the lattice sites occupied by the Li, Ti, Nb and O atoms at atomic-scale.

Unlike propylene carbonate based electrolytes, the rate capability of LiO2 cells tested with 1,2-dimethoxyethane was found not to be limited by oxygen transport in the electrolyte. X-Ray diffraction (XRD) showed lithium peroxide as the discharge product and no evidence of Li2CO3 and LiOH was found. It is hypothesized that higher discharge voltages of cells with Au/C than VC at low rates could have originated from higher oxygen reduction activity of Au/C. At high rates, higher discharge voltages with Au/C than VC could be attributed to faster lithium transport in nonstoichiometric and defective lithium peroxide formed upon discharge, which is supported by XRD and X-ray absorption near edge structure O and Li K edge data.}

Adding Ni having a higher electron work function to X70 steel brings more ``free'' electrons to the steel, leading to increased overall work function, accompanied with enhanced e - \textendash nuclei interactions or higher atomic bond strength. Young's modulus and hardness increase correspondingly. However, the free electron density and work function decrease as the Ni content is continuously increased, accompanied with the formation of a second phase, FeNi 3 , which is softer with a lower work function. The decrease in the overall work function corresponds to deterioration of the mechanical strength of the steel. It is expected that EWF, a simple but fundamental parameter, may lead to new methodologies or supplementary approaches for metallic materials design or tailoring on a feasible electronic base.},

Rechargeable energy storage systems with high energy density and round-trip efficiency are urgently needed to capture and deliver renewable energy for applications such as electric transportation. Lithium-air / lithium-oxygen (Li-O2) batteries have received extraordinary research attention recently owing to their potential to provide positive electrode 15 gravimetric energies considerably higher ({$\sim$}3-5x) than Li-ion positive electrodes, although the packaged device energy density advantage will be lower ({$\sim$}2x). In light of the major technological challenges of Li-O2 batteries, we discuss current understanding developed in non-carbonate electrolytes of Li-O2 redox chemistry upon discharge and charge, oxygen reduction reaction product characteristics upon discharge, and the chemical instability of electrolytes and carbon commonly used in the oxygen electrode. We show that the kinetics of oxygen reduction reaction are influenced by 20 catalysts at small discharge capacities (Li2O2 thickness less than {$\sim$} 1 nm), but not at large Li2O2 thicknesses, yielding insights into the governing processes during discharge. In addition, we discuss the characteristics of discharge products (mainly Li2O2) including morphological, electronic and surface features and parasitic reactivity with carbon. On charge, we examine the reaction mechanism of the oxygen evolution reaction from Li2O2 and the influence of catalysts on bulk Li2O2 decomposition. These analyses provide insights into major discrepancies regarding Li-O2 charge kinetics and the 25 role of catalyst. In light of these findings, we highlight open questions and challenges in the Li-O2 field relevant to developing practical, reversible batteries that achieve the anticipated energy density advantage with a long cycle life.}

However, there have been no reports of a battery based on lithium superoxide (LiO 2 ), despite much research 4\textendash 8 into the lithium\textendash oxygen (Li\textendash O 2 ) battery because of its potential high energy density. Several studies 9\textendash 16 of Li\textendash O 2 batteries have found evidence of LiO 2 being formed as one component of the discharge product along with lithium peroxide (Li 2 O 2 ). In addition, theoretical calculations have indicated that some forms of LiO 2 may have a long lifetime 17 . These studies also suggest that it might be possible to form LiO 2 alone for use in a battery. However, solid LiO has been difficult to synthesize in pure form 18 because it is 2 thermodynamically unstable with respect to disproportionation, giving Li O (refs 19, 20). Here we show that crystalline LiO 2 can 2 2 be stabilized in a Li\textendash O 2 battery by using a suitable graphene-based cathode. Various characterization techniques reveal no evidence for the presence of Li 2 O 2 . A novel templating growth mechanism involving the use of iridium nanoparticles on the cathode surface may be responsible for the growth of crystalline LiO 2 . Our results demonstrate that the LiO 2 formed in the Li\textendash O 2 battery is stable enough for the battery to be repeatedly charged and discharged with a very low charge potential (about 3.2 volts). We anticipate that this discovery will lead to methods of synthesizing and stabilizing LiO , which could open the way to high-energy-density batteries based on LiO 2 as well as to other possible uses of this compound, such as oxygen storage.},

A molecular-level understanding of the reversible formation of lithium peroxide in these batteries, the properties of major/minor discharge products, and the stability of the nonaqueous electrolytes is required to achieve successful lithium-oxygen batteries. We demonstrate that the major discharge product formed in the lithium-oxygen cell, lithium peroxide, exhibits a magnetic moment. These results are based on dc-magnetization measurements and a lithium-oxygen cell containing an ether-based electrolyte. The results are unexpected because bulk lithium peroxide has a significant band gap. Density functional calculations predict that superoxide-type surface oxygen groups with unpaired electrons exist on stoichiometric lithium peroxide crystalline surfaces and on nanoparticle surfaces; these computational results are consistent with the magnetic measurement of the discharged lithium peroxide product as well as EPR measurements on commercial lithium peroxide. The presence of superoxide-type surface oxygen groups with spin can play a role in the reversible formation and decomposition of lithium peroxide as well as the reversible formation and decomposition of electrolyte molecules.},

  abstract = {Optoelectronic devices based on hybrid perovskites have demonstrated outstanding performance within a few years of intense study. However, commercialization of these devices requires barriers to their development to be overcome, such as their chemical instability under operating conditions. To investigate this instability and its consequences, the electric field applied to single crystals of methylammonium lead bromide (CH3NH3PbBr3) is varied, and changes are mapped in both their elemental composition and photoluminescence. Synchrotron-based nanoprobe X-ray fluorescence (nanoXRF) with 250 nm resolution reveals quasi-reversible field-assisted halide migration, with corresponding changes in photoluminescence. It is observed that higher local bromide concentration is correlated to superior optoelectronic performance in CH3NH3PbBr3. A lower limit on the electromigration rate is calculated from these experiments and the motion is interpreted as vacancy-mediated migration based on nudged elastic band density functional theory (DFT) simulations. The XRF mapping data provide direct evidence of field-assisted ionic migration in a model hybrid-perovskite thin single crystal, while the link with photoluminescence proves that the halide stoichiometry plays a key role in the optoelectronic properties of the perovskite.},

In the first step, Na-buserite is synthesized by aging a MnO(x)() gel, which is produced from the oxidation of Mn(OH)(2) in NaOH solutions by KMnO(4) in the presence of Mg(2+). Stabilization of Na-buserite is done by further aging the as-synthesized buserite in distilled deionized water. Physical and chemical changes during the second aging (stabilization) have been investigated by using X-ray diffraction (XRD), infrared (IR), scanning electronic microscopy and energy-dispersive X-ray studies (SEM/EDX), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), cyclic voltammetry (CV), and temperature-programmed desorption combined with mass spectrometer (TPD-MS). The amount and type of metals incorporated into buserite and todorokite are greatly increased by the second aging treatment (including many lanthanides, whose incorporation has not been reported before). The metal species introduced in the layers considerably change the interlayer distances and, accordingly, the cell parameters. A criterion is obtained for the transformation of todorokite-type tunnel MnO(x)() materials from buserite-type layered MnO(x)() by hydrothermal treatment: only buserites which are stable at elevated temperatures in aqueous systems can convert to a todorokite structure; unstable buserites form a structure whose main d spacings are at 3.56 and 7.1 \textbackslash AA. Interconversions among several layered MnO(x)() are also discussed.},

Samples with x 5 1/6, 1/4, 1/3, 5/12, and 1/2 have been investigated by X-ray diffraction {$\sim$}XRD! and neutron diffraction as well as by electrochemical measurements. The XRD and neutron diffraction patterns of Li@NixLi1/322x/3Mn2/32x/3]O2 {$\sim$}0 , x \textbackslash textless 1/2! show that these compounds adopt the O3-LiCoO2-type structure when synthesized at 800\textdegree C and higher. XRD and neutron diffraction also suggest a short-range superlattice ordering of Li, Ni, and Mn in the transition-metal layer for many of the samples. When synthesized at 700\textdegree C and lower, the compounds {$\sim$}for x 5 1/3 and 1/2! appear to adopt a spinel-type structure like LT-LiCoO2. Electrochemical studies show that Li@NixLi1/322x/3Mn2/32x/3]O2 {$\sim$}900\textdegree C! with x 5 5/12 can deliver a stable capacity of about 160 mAh/g between 3.0 and 4.4 V vs. Li.

Li@NixLi(1/322x/3)Mn(2/32x/3)\#O2 is derived from Li2MnO3 or Li@Li1/3Mn2/3\#O2 by substitution of Li1 and Mn41 by Ni21 while maintaining all the remaining Mn atoms in the 41 oxidation state. Conventional wisdom suggests that lithium can be removed from these materials only until both the Ni and Mn oxidation states reach 41, giving a charge capacity of 2x. We show that Li/Li@NixLi(1/322x/3)Mn(2/32x/3)\#O2 cells give smooth reversible voltage profiles reaching about 4.45 V when 2x Li atoms per formula unit are removed, as expected. If the cells are charged to higher voltages, surprisingly, they exhibit a long plateau of length approximately equal to 1 2 2x in the range between 4.5 and 4.7 V. Subsequent to this plateau, the materials can reversibly cycle over 225 mAh/g {$\sim$}almost one Li atom per formula unit! between 2.0 and 4.8 V. In situ X-ray diffraction and differential capacity measurements are used to infer that irreversible loss of oxygen from the compounds with x , 1/2 occurs during the first charge to 4.8 V. This results in oxygen deficient layered materials with stoichiometry approximately equal to @ \# 3 @NixLi(122x)/3Mn(22x)/3\#O1.51x at 4.8 V. These oxygen deficient materials then react reversibly with lithium.},

The free energy curves for solvent fluctuations are found to be approximately parabolic and the Marcus solvent reorganization free energies and activation free energies are determined for six possible redox processes in each solvent. The similarities between the different types of solvent are striking and are attributed to the essentially long-range nature of the relevant interactions and the effectiveness of the screening of the ion potential.

  abstract = {Ionic liquids are liquids comprised totally of ions. However, not all of the ions present appear to be available to participate in conduction processes, to a degree that is dependent on the nature of the ionic liquid and its structure. There is much interest in quantifying and understanding this 'degree of ionicity' phenomenon. In this paper we present transport data for a range of ionic liquids and evaluate the data firstly in terms of the Walden plot as an approximate and readily accessible approach to estimating ionicity. An adjusted Walden plot that makes explicit allowance for differences in ion sizes is shown to be an improvement to this approach for the series of ionic liquids described. In some cases, where diffusion measurements are possible, it is feasible to directly quantify ionicity via the Nernst-Einstein equation, confirming the validity of the adjusted Walden plot approach. Some of the ionic liquids studied exhibit ionicity values very close to ideal; this is discussed in terms of a model of a highly associated liquid in which the ion correlations have similar impact on both the diffusive and conductive motions. Ionicity, as defined, is thus a useful measure of adherence to the Nernst-Einstein equation, but is not necessarily a measure of ion availability in the chemical sense.},

  abstract = {Ionic liquids offer a unique suite of properties that make them important candidates for a number of energy related applications. Cation \textendash{} anion combinations that exhibit low volatility coupled with high electrochemical and thermal stability, as well as ionic conductivity, create the possibility of designing ideal electrolytes for batteries, supercapacitors, dye sensitised solar cells and thermo-electrochemical cells. In the field of water splitting to produce hydrogen they have been used to synthesize some of the best performing water oxidation catalysts and some members of the protic ionic liquid family co-catalyse an unusual, very high energy efficiency water oxidation process. As fuel cell electrolytes, the high proton conductivity of some of the protic ionic liquid family offers the potential of fuel cells operating in the optimum temperature region above 100\textdegree C. Beyond electrochemical applications, the low vapour pressure of these liquids, along with their ability to offer tuneable functionality, also makes them ideal as CO2 absorbents for post-combustion CO2 capture. Similarly, the tuneable phase properties of the many members of this large family of salts are also allowing the creation of phase-change thermal energy storage materials having melting points tuned to the application. This perspective article provides an overview of these developing energy related applications of ionic liquids and offers some thoughts on the emerging challenges and opportunities.}

But however complex the crystal might be, this energy landscape is of parabolic shape near its minima. Roughly speaking, the depth of this energy well with respect to some reference level determines the thermodynamic stability of the system, and the steepness of the parabola near its minimum determines the system's elastic properties. Although changing alloying elements and their concentrations in a given material to enhance certain properties dates back to the Bronze Age1,2, the systematic search for desirable properties in metastable atomic configurations at a fixed stoichiometry is a very recent tool in materials design3. Here we demonstrate, using first-principles studies of four binary alloy systems, that the elastic properties of face-centred-cubic intermetallic compounds obey certain rules. We reach two conclusions based on calculations on a huge subset of the face-centred-cubic configuration space. First, the stiffness and the heat of formation are negatively correlated with a nearly constant Spearman correlation4 for all concentrations. Second, the averaged stiffness of metastable configurations at a fixed concentration decays linearly with their distance to the ground-state line (the phase diagram of an alloy at zero Kelvin). We hope that our methods will help to simplify the quest for new materials with optimal properties from the vast configuration space available.}

  abstract = {Lithium-ion batteries are a key technology for multiple clean energy applications. Their energy and power density is largely determined by the cathode materials, which store Li by incorporation into their crystal structure. Most commercialized cathode materials, such as LiCoO(2) (ref. 1), LiMn(2)O(4) (ref. 2), Li(Ni,Co,Al)O(2) or Li(Ni,Co,Mn)O(2) (ref. 3), form solid solutions over a large concentration range, with occasional weak first-order transitions as a result of ordering of Li or electronic effects. An exception is LiFePO(4), which stores Li through a two-phase transformation between FePO(4) and LiFePO(4) (refs 5-8). Notwithstanding having to overcome extra kinetic barriers, such as nucleation of the second phase and growth through interface motion, the observed rate capability of LiFePO(4) has become remarkably high. In particular, once transport limitations at the electrode level are removed through carbon addition and particle size reduction, the innate rate capability of LiFePO(4) is revealed to be very high. We demonstrate that the reason LiFePO(4) functions as a cathode at reasonable rate is the availability of a single-phase transformation path at very low overpotential, allowing the system to bypass nucleation and growth of a second phase. The Li(x)FePO(4) system is an example where the kinetic transformation path between LiFePO(4) and FePO(4) is fundamentally different from the path deduced from its equilibrium phase diagram.},

  abstract = {Accurate and speedy determination of transition structures (TSs) is essential for computational studies on reaction pathways, particularly when the process involves expensive electronic structure calculations. Many search algorithms require a good initial guess of the TS geometry, as well as a Hessian input that possesses a structure consistent with the desired saddle point. Among the double-ended interpolation methods for generation of the guess for the TS, the freezing string method (FSM) is proven to be far less expensive compared to its predecessor, the growing string method (GSM). In this paper, it is demonstrated that the efficiency of this technique can be improved further by replacing the conjugate gradient optimization step (FSM-CG) with a quasi-Newton line search coupled with a BFGS Hessian update (FSM-BFGS). A second crucial factor that affects the speed with which convergence to the TS is achieved is the quality and cost of the Hessian of the energy for the guessed TS. For electronic structure calculations, the cost of calculating an exact Hessian increases more rapidly with system size than the energy and gradient. Therefore, to sidestep calculation of the exact Hessian, an approximate Hessian is constructed, using the tangent direction and local curvature at the TS guess. It is demonstrated that the partitioned-rational function optimization algorithm for locating TSs with this approximate Hessian input performs at least as well as with an exact Hessian input in most test cases. The two techniques, FSM and approximate Hessian construction, therefore can significantly reduce costs associated with finding TSs.},

  abstract = {Hard and superhard materials are essential for a myriad of scientific, biomedical, and industrial applications. Their ability to resist indentation stems from the relationship between the crystal structure, chemical composition, and microstructure. The complexity of this interdependence has limited researchers to often conduct comprehensive experimental investigations, with occasional support by computation. One of the main difficulties is that hardness is influenced by many factors, which requires many comprehensive calculations to account for multiple length scales ranging from atomic interactions (intrinsic hardness) to long length scales encompassing microstructure (extrinsic hardness). Nevertheless, improvements in computational methodologies and access to high-performance computing clusters have provided essential insight on the mechanisms of deformation, as well as pinpointed some crystal chemical traits that generate high hardness. This contribution discusses notable computational developments in the field spanning multiple length scales, including modeling the process of indentation through molecular dynamics, identifying computational theories of hardness through density functional theory, and screening for optimal materials through machine learning. Reviewing these research accomplishments not only highlights some important projects, but it also provides indications of potential research directions and opportunities to advance the development of hard and superhard materials through computation.},

  abstract = {A crystal-chemical guide is provided for understanding how factors such as the crystal structure and covalency of the polyanion affect the M2+/3+ redox energies in polyanion cathodes. Although there are more rigorous techniques available, our approach is precise in spite of being simple. We show that an accurate prediction can be made with regard to the voltages delivered based on a basic understanding of how the coordination of the transition-metal ion affects the covalency of the M-O bond. Additionally, a new method for assessing the covalency of the polyanion (beyond the electronegativity of the countercation) is presented and used to explain why the voltage delivered by Li2MP2O7 cathodes is higher than that of LiMPO4. Furthermore, a comparison of the silicate and phosphate structures reveals that edge sharing between transition metal polyhedra and other cation polyhedra has an opposite effect on the voltage delivered by these materials. For instance, edge sharing with LiO4 polyhedra in the silicates raises the M2+/3+ redox energy, whereas edge sharing with PO4 polyhedra in the phosphates lowers the M2+/3+ redox energy. This is due to a difference in the strength of the repulsive force exerted on the transition metal by the P5+ cation when compared to Li+. This observation is significant since edge sharing has generally been viewed as a structural feature that lowers the redox energy. Lastly, crystal field splitting consideration alone is not sufficient to understand the voltage trends for polyanion cathodes and one must consider the contributions of the structure and/ or the inductive effect. Our analysis provides new insights that may prove useful in tuning the voltage of existing polyanion systems and in the design of new cathode materials.},

  abstract = {The LiMn1.5Ni0.5O4 spinel is an attractive cathode candidate for next generation lithium-ion batteries as it offers high power capability with an operating voltage of {$\sim$}4.7 V and a capacity of {$\sim$}135 mA h g-1. However, its commercialization is plagued by severe capacity fade, particularly at elevated temperatures, in full cells employing a graphite anode. This perspective article provides an overview of the recent developments on understanding various factors that influence the electrochemical performance of the high-voltage spinel cathodes. The factors include the degree of cation ordering, Mn3+ content, morphology, and surface planes/compositions in contact with the electrolyte, which are influenced by synthesis and annealing conditions as well as cation doping. For example, samples with a \{111\} family of surface planes show superior performance. Recent magnetic measurements and examination of discharge profiles below 3 V have become valuable to get a more precise measure of the degree of cation ordering. Also, surface modifications and electrolyte additives have shown marginal gains. Although acceptable performances have been obtained in half-cells with a metallic lithium anode, capacity fade is seen in full cells with a graphite anode due to metal dissolution at the high operating voltage of 4.7 V and Li+ consumption by the steadily forming solid-electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer promoted by Mn/Ni deposition on the graphite surface. Based on the current understanding, future directions are pointed out. This journal is \textcopyright{} the Partner Organisations 2014.}

  abstract = {Abstract             Lithium-ion batteries have aided the portable electronics revolution for nearly three decades. They are now enabling vehicle electrification and beginning to enter the utility industry. The emergence and dominance of lithium-ion batteries are due to their higher energy density compared to other rechargeable battery systems, enabled by the design and development of high-energy density electrode materials. Basic science research, involving solid-state chemistry and physics, has been at the center of this endeavor, particularly during the 1970s and 1980s. With the award of the 2019 Nobel Prize in Chemistry to the development of lithium-ion batteries, it is enlightening to look back at the evolution of the cathode chemistry that made the modern lithium-ion technology feasible. This review article provides a reflection on how fundamental studies have facilitated the discovery, optimization, and rational design of three major categories of oxide cathodes for lithium-ion batteries, and a personal perspective on the future of this important area.},

  abstract = {In this article, we describe general trends to be expected at short times when an excess electron is generated or injected in different room-temperature ionic liquids (RTILs). Perhaps surprisingly, the excess electron does not localize systematically on the positively charged cations. Rather, the excess charge localization pattern is determined by the cation and anion HOMO/LUMO gaps and, more importantly, by their relative LUMO alignments. As revealed by experiments, the short-time (ps/ns) transient UV spectrum of excess electrons in RTILs is often characterized by two bands, a broad band at low energies (above 1000 nm) and another weaker band at higher energies (around 400 nm). Our calculations show that the dry or presolvated electron spectrum (fs) also has two similar features. The broad band at low energies is due to transitions between electronic states with similar character on ions of the same class but in different locations of the liquid. The lower-intensity band at higher energies is due to transitions in which the electron is promoted to electronic states of different character, in some cases on counterions. Depending on the chemical nature of the RTIL, and especially on the anions, excess electrons can localize on cations or anions. Our findings hint at possible design strategies for controlling electron localization, where electron transfer or transport across species can be facilitated or blocked depending on the alignment of the electronic levels of the individual species.},

Extensive experimental work has characterized a first-order metal-insulator transition in Li(x)CoO(2), the classic material for rechargeable Li batteries, with a metallic state for x \textbackslash textless 0.75 and insulating for x \textbackslash textgreater 0.95. Using density functional theory calculations on large supercells, we identify the mechanism of this hereto anomalous metal-insulator transition as a Mott transition of impurities. Density functional theory demonstrates that for dilute Li-vacancy concentrations, the vacancy binds a hole and forms impurity states yielding a Mott insulator. The unique feature of Li(x)CoO(2) as compared with traditional doped semiconductors, such as Si:P, is the high mobility of the Li vacancies, which allows them to rearrange into two distinct phases at the temperature of the metal-insulator transition.},

Identifying suitable materials for a given application can, in principle, be done by screening material databases. Such a screening requires automated high-throughput analysis tools that calculate topological and geometrical parameters describing pores. These descriptors can be used to compare, select, group, and classify materials. Here, we present a descriptor that captures shape and geometry characteristics of pores. Together with proposed similarity measures, it can be used to perform diversity selection on a set of porous materials. Our representations are histogram encodings of the probe-accessible fragment of the Voronoi network representing the void space of a material. We discuss and demonstrate the application of our approach on the International Zeolite Association (IZA) database of zeolite frameworks and the Deem database of hypothetical zeolites, as well as zeolitic imidazolate frameworks constructed from IZA zeolite structures. The diverse structures retrieved by our method are complementary to those expected by emphasizing diversity in existing one-dimensional descriptors, e.g., surface area, and similar to those obtainable by a (subjective) manual selection based on materials' visual representations. Our technique allows for reduction of large sets of structures and thus enables the material researcher to focus efforts on maximally dissimilar structures.},

The three class teachers of these preschoolers provided the ratings and perceptions of each child's intellectual maturity. Results indicated that the teachers' assessments of children's intellectual maturity were fairly similar to the formal measures of children's intellectual maturity using human figure drawings and their own perceptions. It appears that teacher ratings of drawings could be relied upon as a means of assessment. General perceptions of children's intellectual maturity should not be solely relied upon, but instead these perceptions should be used as an aid for enhancing the teachers' assessment of children's intellectual maturity in addition to the rating of human figure drawings.},

  abstract = {Spinel LiNi 0.5 Mn 1.5 O 4 with high operating voltage ({$\sim$}4.7 V vs Li/Li + ), high theoretical capacity of 148 mAh g -1 , fast lithium ion diffusion kinetics, and potentially low cost is the most potential candidate material for high energy density LIBs used in plug-in hybrid electric vehicles and pure electric vehicles. However, the high operating voltage of LiNi 0.5 Mn 1.5 O 4 challenges the electrochemical stability of other components in the batteries and induces diverse interfacial side reactions, leading to irreversible capacity loss, poor cycling performance, and safety issues, especially at the elevated temperatures. Thus, a basic understanding of the intrinsic surface properties of LiNi 0.5 Mn 1.5 O 4 and the mechanism of interfacial interactions between each component in the electrochemical system is a critical requirement for developing substantial enhancements of LiNi 0.5 Mn 1.5 O 4 -based batteries. In this review, we summarize the surface/interface reactions and challenges in the whole cell system of LiNi 0.5 Mn 1.5 O 4 -based LIBs. Perspectives and strategies for LiNi 0.5 Mn 1.5 O 4 -based high energy density batteries used in PHEV/EVs are also proposed at last.},

Built on top of open source Python packages already in use by the materials community such as pymatgen, FireWorks, and custodian, atomate provides well-tested workflow templates to compute various materials properties such as electronic bandstructure, elastic properties, and piezoelectric, dielectric, and ferroelectric properties. Atomate also enables the computational characterization of materials by providing workflows that calculate X-ray absorption (XAS), Electron energy loss (EELS) and Raman spectra. One of the major features of atomate is that it provides both fully functional workflows as well as reusable components that enable one to compose complex materials science workflows that use a diverse set of computational tools. Additionally, atomate creates output databases that organize the results from individual calculations and contains a builder framework that creates summary reports for each computed material based on multiple simulations.},

A realistic first-principles computational study of such systems entails the inclusion of solvent effects. In this work, we implement an implicit solvation model that has a firm theoretical foundation into the widely used density-functional code Vienna ab initio Software Package. The implicit solvation model follows the framework of joint density functional theory. We describe the framework, our algorithm and implementation, and benchmarks for small molecular systems. We apply the solvation model to study the surface energies of different facets of semiconducting and metallic nanocrystals and the SN2 reaction pathway. We find that solvation reduces the surface energies of the nanocrystals, especially for the semiconducting ones and increases the energy barrier of the SN2 reaction.},

This confirms the original finding that AM05 performs exceptionally well for solids and surfaces. Hartree-Fock hybrid calculations are typically an order of magnitude slower than local or semilocal density functionals such as AM05, which is of a regular semilocal generalized gradient approximation form. The performance of AM05 is on average found to be superior to selecting the best of local density approximation and PBE for each solid. By comparing data from several different electronic-structure codes, we have determined that the numerical errors in this study are equal to or smaller than the corresponding experimental uncertainties.},

As the materials problems to which DFT is applied have become large and complex, so have the sets of calculations necessary for investigating a given problem. Highly versatile, powerful codes exist to serve the practitioner, but designing useful simulations is a complicated task, involving intricate manipulation of many variables, with many pitfalls for the unwary and the inexperienced. We discuss several of the most important issues that go into designing a meaningful DFT calculation. We emphasize the necessity of investigating these issues and reporting the critical details.},

Three sources for the discrepancy between the calculated and experimental solvation free energies were considered: the multibody terms were estimated using a polarization model; the long-range contributions were estimated with the Born correction and with a calculation using larger system size; and the extent of charge transfer was examined by ab initio calculations based on complete solvation shells extracted from the simulation.},

The solid solution was found to phase separate during slow cooling (1 \textdegree C/min). The end points of this coexistence are not LiCoO2 and Li2MnO3: instead the Co-rich phase contains some Mn and the Mn-rich phase contains some Co. This phase separation occurs at compositions where previous studies showed nanodomain phase separation when an intermediate cooling rate was used. The nanoscale composites are therefore an intermediate structure that forms when there is insufficient time during cooling for large scale crystallites of the new phases to form. A simple Monte Carlo simulation was used to illustrate this phase separation and study the impact of cooling rate.},

  abstract = {Quantitative differential electrochemical mass spectrometry and cyclic voltammetry have been combined to probe possible mechanisms and the kinetic overpotentials, responsible for discharge and charge in a Li-O2 battery, using C as the cathode and an electrolyte based on dimethoxyethane as the solvent. Previous spectroscopy experiments (X-ray diffraction, {$\mu$}Raman, IR, XPS) have shown that Li2O2 is the principle product formed during Li-O2 discharge using this electrolyte/cathode combination. At all discharge potentials and charge potentials \textbackslash textless4.0 V, the observed electrochemistry is {$\sim$}2e-/O2 consumed or produced, also implying that Li2O2 is the dominant thermodynamically stable species formed and consumed in the electrochemistry. No evidence exists at any potential for formation of stable LiO2 (1e-/O2) or Li2O (4e-/O2) during discharge. At charging potentials \textbackslash textgreater4.0 V, the electrochemistry requires significantly more than 2e-/O2, and we take this as evidence for electrolyte decomposition. We find that sequential concerted (Li+ + e-) ion transfers to/from adsorbed O2* and LiO2* to produce/consume Li2O2 is the mechanism that is most compatible with these experiments. The kinetic overpotentials are extremely low relative to aqueous O2 reduction and evolution, and this implies that in principle a discharge-charge Li-O2 cycle is possible with high voltaic efficiency ({$\sim$}85\%) if electrolyte and cathode stability issues are resolved.},

Many of the principles which enable ``synthesis by design'' in synthetic organic chemistry do not exist in solid-state chemistry, despite the availability of extensive computed/experimental thermochemistry data. In this work, we present a chemical reaction network model for solid-state synthesis constructed from available thermochemistry data and devise a computationally tractable approach for suggesting likely reaction pathways via the application of pathfinding algorithms and linear combination of lowest-cost paths in the network. We demonstrate initial success of the network in predicting complex reaction pathways comparable to those reported in the literature for YMnO               3               , Y               2               Mn               2               O               7               , Fe               2               SiS               4               , and YBa               2               Cu               3               O               6.5               .

The study results revealed that the three-dimensional (3D) dye-sensitized solar cells fabricated with TiO2 bilayer film increased by 32.7\% in the max output power as compared to the TiO2 NPs film under AM1.5G condition.

A new goal in portable power is the achievement of safe and durable high-power batteries for applications such as power tools and electric vehicles. Towards this end, olivine-based positive electrodes are amongst the most important and technologically enabling materials. While certain lithium metal phosphate olivines have been shown to be promising, not all olivines demonstrate beneficial properties. The mechanisms allowing high power in these compounds have been extensively debated. Here we show that certain high rate capability olivines are distinguished by having extended lithium nonstoichiometry (up to ca. 20 \%), with which is correlated a reduced lattice misfit as the material undergoes an electrochemically driven, reversible, first-order phase transformation. The rate capability in several other intercalation oxides can also be correlated with lattice strain, and suggests that nanomechanics plays an important and previously unrecognized role in determining battery performance.},

Using density functional theory in the generalized gradient approximation (GGA), combined with a cluster expansion structure prediction algorithm we have found an intricate set of Na-vacancy ordered ground states in Na(x)CoO(2) (0.5\textbackslash textless or =x\textbackslash textless or =1). We demonstrate a newly predicted ordering pattern between 0.67\textbackslash textless or =x\textbackslash textless or =0.71. By comparing the first principles electronic structure methods within the GGA and GGA+U (Hubbard U correction) approximations, we demonstrate that at certain Na concentration the stable ordering is affected by charge localization on the Co layer through coupling between the Na and Co lattices.},

Per unit cell, four out of six octahedral sites are occupied by Li ions, and the other two are statistically filled (0.5) by P-P pairs. The P-P central bond (2.256( 13) A) links two staggered PSs groups (P-S = 2.032(5) A) to form the Dad symmetry P\&Y anion. Infrared and Raman spectra show features very similar to those of Na,P\&, 6H,O and MOP\& compounds. A new assignment in terms of symmetry species is proposed for the P\& internal modes, which is confirmed by a normal coordinate calculation using a valence force field; the stretching force constants fr.+ and \&s are equal to 1.6 and 2.7 mdyne A-l, respectively.},

We use this model to scan roughly 1.6 million candidate compositions for novel ternary compounds (AxByCz), and predict 4500 new stable materials.

E(ox) values were obtained from a combination of equilibrium electron-transfer measurements and electron-transfer kinetics of radical cations produced from pairs of benzene and biphenyl derivatives, with one member of the pair acting as a reference. Using a redox-ladder approach, thermodynamic oxidation potentials were determined for 21 benzene and biphenyl derivatives. Of particular interest, E(ox) values of 2.48 +/- 0.03 and 2.26 +/- 0.02 V vs SCE were obtained for benzene and toluene, respectively. Because of a significant increase in solvent stabilization of the radical cations with decreasing alkyl substitution, the difference between ionization and oxidation potentials of benzene is approximately 0.5 eV larger than that of hexamethylbenzene. Oxidation potentials of the biphenyl derivatives show an excellent correlation with substituent sigma+ values, which allows E(ox) predictions for other biphenyl derivatives. Significant dimer radical cation formation was observed in several cases and equilibrium constants for dimerization were determined. Methodologies are described for determining accurate electron-transfer equilibrium constants even when dimer radical cations are formed. Additional equilibrium measurements in trifluoroacetic acid, methylene chloride, and ethyl acetate demonstrated that solvation differences can substantially alter and even reverse relative E(ox) values.},

  abstract = {With the constant growth of the lithium battery market and the introduction of electric vehicles and station- ary energy storage solutions, the low abundance and high price of lithium will greatly impact its availability in the future. Thus, a diversification of electrochemical energy stor- age technologies based on other source materials is of great relevance. Sodium is energetically similar to lithium but cheaper and more abundant, which results in some already established stationary concepts, such as Na-S and ZEBRA cells. The most significant bottleneck for these technologies is to find effective solid ionic conductors. Thus, the goal of this work is to identify new ionic conductors for Na ions in ternary Na oxides. For this purpose, the Voronoi\textendash Dirichlet approach has been applied to the Inorganic Crystal Structure Database and some new procedures are introduced to the algorithm implemented in the programme package Topo- sPro. The main new features are the use of data mined values, which are then used for the evaluation of void spaces, and a new method of channel size calculation. 52 compounds have been identified to be high-potential candi- dates for solid ionic conductors. The results were analysed from a crystallographic point of view in combination with phenomenological requirements for ionic conductors and in- tercalation hosts. Of the most promising candidates, previ- ously reported compounds have also been successfully iden- tified by using the employed algorithm, which shows the re- liability of the method.},

  abstract = {A constitutive approach is developed that predicts the critical stress for twinning as a function of external (temperature, strain rate) and internal (grain size, stacking-fault energy) parameters. Plastic deformation by slip and twinning are considered as competitive mechanisms. The twinning stress is equated to the slip stress based on the plastic flow by thermally assisted movement of dislocations over obstacles, which leads to successful prediction of the slip-twinning transition. The model is applied to body centered cubic, face centered cubic, and hexagonal metals and alloys: Fe, Cu, brasses, and Ti, respectively. A constitutive expression for the twinning stress in BCC metals is developed using dislocation emission from a source and the formation of pile-ups, as rate-controlling mechanism. Employing an Eshelby-type analysis, the critical size of twin nucleus and twinning stress are correlated to the twin-boundary energy, which is directly related to the stacking-fault energy (SFE) for FCC metals. The effects of grain size and SFE are examined and the results indicate that the grain-scale pile-ups are not the source of the stress concentrations giving rise to twinning in FCC metals. The constitutive description of the slip-twinning transition are incorporated into the Weertman-Ashby deformation mechanism maps, thereby enabling the introduction of a twinning domain. This is illustrated for titanium with a grain size of 100 {$\mu$}m. \textcopyright{} 2001 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Our results indicate that doping does not greatly alter the topology of the migration pathway, but instead acts primarily to change the lithium concentration. The structure with the lowest activation energy and highest room temperature conductivity is Li6.75La3Zr1.75Ta0.25O12 (Ea = 19 meV, {$\sigma$}300K = 1 x 10-2 S cm-1). All Ta-doped structures have significantly higher ionic conductivity than the undoped cubic Li7La3Zr2O12 (c-LLZO, Ea = 24 meV, {$\sigma$}300K = 2 x 10-3 S cm-1). The Rb-doped structure with composition Li7.25La2.875Rb0.125Zr2O12, has a lower activation energy than c-LLZO, but further Rb doping leads to a dramatic decrease in performance. We also examined the effect of changing the lattice parameter at fixed lithium concentration and found that a decrease in the lattice parameter leads to a rapid decline in Li+ conductivity, whereas an expanded lattice offers only marginal improvement. This result suggests that doping with larger cations will not provide a significant enhancement in performance. Our results find higher conductivity and lower activation energy than is typically reported in the experimental literature, which suggests that there is room for improving the total conductivity in these promising materials.},

Increasing lithium content supports the formation of the rhombohedral form. In situ structural investigations during electrochemical Li extraction and insertion between 2.43.5 V on Li1.0MoO2 material containing rhombohedral and monoclinic modifications with endless molybdenum chains revealed the instability of the monoclinic Li0.9MoO2 form with decreasing Li content against transformation into two rhombohedral phases LixMoO2 and Lix{$\approx$}0MoO2. In contrast, the rhombohedral Li1.0(Mo0.9Li0.1)O2 form showed a topotactical single-phase behavior during Li extraction and insertion. Further oxidation of LixMoO2 at voltages above 4.5 V led to insertion of large anions such as PF6 or BF4 into the crystal structure. The Li-free rhombohedral form is stable in Ar up to 570 K and transforms irreversibly at higher temperature into a rutile-like structure.},

  abstract = {During Li-insertion in some complex transition metal molybdates with a NASICON structure, which serve as cathodes in Li-ion rechargeable cells, a formation of a cubic rock-salt-type phase was often detected between 1 and 2 V vs Li+/Li. Detailed information about elemental composition and stability of this compound was missing, and suggestions were made toward a solid solution composed of lithium oxide and two-valence transition metal oxide MO with M a 3d element. In the present work, we showed that Li2MoO4 with a phenacite-type structure without any additional transition metal can reversibly accommodate Li-ions at room temperature with the formation of the NaCl-type compound. Reversible Li-incorporation into the Li2MoO4 structure is accompanied by a reduction of Mo ions and changes in their oxygen coordination. Li-ions are shifted from a tetrahedral to an octahedral site, resulting in the formation of a cubic (Li3Mo)O4 framework with a random distribution of Li and Mo on one site. This mixed occupancy is remarkable because of significant charge and size differences between Li+ and Mo5+. The novel compound shows Li-deficiency at least up to xLi = 0.2, which can be deduced from charge flow in the galvanostatic cycling of the electrochemical cells with a (Li3Mo)O4 cathode between 1.5 and 2.75 V vs Li+/Li. An increase in the cell potential above 3 V leads to the oxidation of (Li3Mo)O4 back to Li2MoO4 with phenacite-type structure. The reaction of (Li3Mo)O4 to Li2MoO4 also occurs upon a short exposure to air.},

Our nominal model has about 2 Earth masses of planetary ices in the H-He-rich mantle, a result that is, within modeling errors, consistent with abundances measured by the 1995 Galileo Entry Probe mission (equivalent to about 5 Earth masses of planetary ices when extrapolated to the mantle), suggesting that the composition found by the probe may be representative of the entire planet. Interior models derived from this first-principles EOS do not give a match to Jupiter's gravity moment J4 unless one invokes interior differential rotation, implying that jovian interior dynamics has an observable effect on the measured gravity field.},

However, MAPbI3 is known to have chemical instability, i.e., MAPbI3 is prone to decomposition to MAI and PbI2 even at moderate temperatures (e.g. 330 K). Here, we show that the chemical instability, as reflected by the calculated negligible enthalpy of formation for MAPbI3 (with respect to MAI and PbI2), has an unusual and important consequence in defect properties, i.e., defect formation energies in low-carrier-density MAPbI3 is nearly independent of chemical potentials of constituent elements and thus can be uniquely determined. This allows straightforward calculations of defect concentrations and the activation energy of ionic conductivity (the sum of the formation energy and the diffusion barrier of the charged mobile defect) in MAPbI3. The calculated activation energy for ionic conductivity due to diffusion is in excellent agreement with the experimental values, which demonstrates unambiguously that is the dominant diffusing defect and is responsible for the observed ion migration and device polarization in MAPbI3 solar cells. Calculated low formation energy of a Frenkel pair ( - pair) and low diffusion barriers of and suggest that the iodine ion migration and the resulting device polarization may occur even in single-crystal devices and grain-boundary-passivated polycrystalline thin film devices (which were previously suggested to be free from ion-migration-induced device polarization), leading to device degradation. However, the device polarization due to the Frenkel pair (which has a relatively low concentration) may take long time to develop and thus may avoid the appearance of the current-voltage hysteresis at typical scan rates.},

Despite this potential, thermoelectric devices are not in common use because of their low efficiency, and today they are only used in niche markets where reliability and simplicity are more important than performance. However, the ability to create nanostructured thermoelectric materials has led to remarkable progress in enhancing thermoelectric properties, making it plausible that thermoelectrics could start being used in new settings in the near future. Of the various types of nanostructured materials, bulk nanostructured materials have shown the most promise for commercial use because, unlike many other nanostructured materials, they can be fabricated in large quantities and in a form that is compatible with existing thermoelectric device configurations. The first generation of these materials is currently being developed for commercialization, but creating the second generation will require a fundamental understanding of carrier transport in these complex materials which is presently lacking. In this review we introduce the principles and present status of bulk nanostructured materials, then describe some of the unanswered questions about carrier transport and how current research is addressing these questions. Finally, we discuss several research directions which could lead to the next generation of bulk nanostructured materials.}

Chinese cabbage seeds were sown and raised in three 200-cell plug trays filled with growing mixture in a plant growth chamber with three different levels (40\%, 80\%, and 100\%) of required N. Reflectance for leaves of chinese cabbage seedlings was measured with a spectrophotometer 15 days after the experiment started. Reflectance was measured in the 400 to 2500 nm wavelength range at 1.1-nm increments. The leaves were dried afterwards to measure their water content and were analyzed for their actual N contents. The experiment was repeated twice (group I and II). Correlation coefficient spectrum, standard deviation spectrum, stepwise multiple linear regression (SMLR), and partial least squares (PLS) regression were used to determine wavelengths for N prediction models. Performances of SMLR and PLS were similar. For the validation data set (group II), SMLR produced an               r               2               of 0.846 and PLS yielded               r               2               of 0.840.

Water content positively correlated with N concentration (               r               = 0.76). Wavelengths of 1467, 1910, and 1938 nm selected by SMLR from both groups also showed that water had a strong effect on N prediction. Wavelengths near 2136 nm indicated that protein had potential use in N prediction. Wavelengths near 550 and 840 nm could also contribute to N prediction.},

  abstract = {High entropy alloys (HEAs) are barely 12 years old. The field has stimulated new ideas and has inspired the exploration of the vast composition space offered by multi-principal element alloys (MPEAs). Here we present a critical review of this field, with the intent of summarizing key findings, uncovering major trends and providing guidance for future efforts. Major themes in this assessment include definition of terms; thermodynamic analysis of complex, concentrated alloys (CCAs); taxonomy of current alloy families; microstructures; mechanical properties; potential applications; and future efforts. Based on detailed analyses, the following major results emerge. Although classical thermodynamic concepts are unchanged, trends in MPEAs can be different than in simpler alloys. Common thermodynamic perceptions can be misleading and new trends are described. From a strong focus on 3d transition metal alloys, there are now seven distinct CCA families. A new theme of designing alloy families by selecting elements to achieve a specific, intended purpose is starting to emerge. A comprehensive microstructural assessment is performed using three datasets: experimental data drawn from 408 different alloys and two computational datasets generated using the CALculated PHAse Diagram (CALPHAD) method. Each dataset emphasizes different elements and shows different microstructural trends. Trends in these three datasets are all predicted by a `structure in \textendash{} structure out' (SISO) analysis developed here that uses the weighted fractions of the constituent element crystal structures in each dataset. A total of 13 distinct multi-principal element single-phase fields are found in this microstructural assessment. Relationships between composition, microstructure and properties are established for 3d transition metal MPEAs, including the roles of Al, Cr and Cu. Critical evaluation shows that commercial austenitic stainless steels and nickel alloys with 3 or more principal elements are MPEAs, as well as some established functional materials. Mechanical properties of 3d transition metal CCAs are equivalent to commercial austenitic stainless steels and nickel alloys, while some refractory metal CCAs show potential to extend the service strength and/or temperature of nickel superalloys. Detailed analyses of microstructures and properties allow two major HEA hypotheses to be resolved. Although the `entropy effect' is not supported by the present data, it has nevertheless made an enduring contribution by inspiring a clearer understanding of the importance of configurational entropy on phase stability. The `sluggish diffusion' hypothesis is also not supported by available data, but it motivates re-evaluation of a classical concept of metallic diffusion. Building on recent published work, the CCA field has expanded to include materials with metallic, ionic or covalent bonding. It also includes microstructures with any number of phases and any type of phases. Finally, the MPEA field is shown to include both structural and functional materials applications. A significant number of future efforts are recommended, with an emphasis on developing high-throughput experiments and computations for structural materials. The review concludes with a brief description of major accomplishments of the field and insights gained from the first 12 years of research. The field has lost none of its potency and continues to pose new questions and offer new possibilities. The vast range of complex compositions and microstructures remains the most compelling motivation for future studies.},

The emission from the Eu2+ ions occupying the nine coordinated site (M2) is blue- shifted and could be due to an anomalous transition. This conclusion is based on analyzes of the partial density of states of the 5d-like states of Eu and Ba or Sr ions. The lowest energy 5d-like states associated with Eu ions at M1 lie below the conduction band, while those for the M2 site move into the conduction band. Thus, the excited state of Eu at M2 will resonate with the Ba or Sr 5d-like states and could lead to anomalous transition.},

  abstract = {A new polymorph of NaSbO(3) has been synthesized at 10.5 GPa and 1150 degrees C in a uniaxial split sphere anvil type press (USSA-2000) and recovered back to ambient conditions. The high-pressure form of NaSbO(3) adopts an orthorhombically distorted perovskite structure, isostructural with CaTiO(3), GdFeO(3), and NaTaO(3). The space group is Pnma, and the unit cell dimensions are a = 5.43835(6) A, b = 7.66195(8) A, c = 5.38201(5) A. It is a white insulator with an optical band gap of 3.4 eV. This compound represents the first ternary perovskite prepared containing Sb(5+) on the octahedral site. The octahedral tilting distortion in this compound is much larger than expected from ionic radii considerations. The distortion is driven by a second-order Jahn-Teller distortion originating on oxygen that can be traced back to strong Sb-O covalent bonding. A conflict arises between the strong covalent bonding interactions at oxygen that favor a large octahedral tilting distortion and the repulsive Na-O interactions that oppose excessive octahedral tilting. This conflict destabilizes the perovskite topology, thereby stabilizing the ilmenite polymorph under ambient conditions. Analysis of ionic and covalent bonding explains why ASbO(3) and ABiO(3) compositions frequently adopt structures that violate Pauling's rules.},

However, this new battery technology is facing substantial challenges, such as a high overpotential upon charging, poor reversibility, and low power density. Using first-principles calculations, we study the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) on the low-index surfaces of lithium peroxide. The elementary reaction steps and the energy profile of the OER are identified on the low-index surfaces of lithium peroxide. We find that the OER processes are kinetically limited by the high energy barrier for the evolution of oxygen molecules and that the rate of the OER processes is highly dependent on the surface orientation.},

Acta, 40, 599 (1995)]. This work treats interfacial stability in lithium/polymer systems where the electrolyte is solid. Linear elasticity theory is employed to compute the additional effect of bulk mechanical forces on electrode stability. The lithium and polymer are treated as Hookean elastic materials, characterized by their shear moduli and Poisson's ratios. Two-dimensional displacement distributions that satisfy force balances across a periodically deforming interface are derived; these allow computation of the stress and surface-tension forces. The incorporation of elastic effects into a kinetic model demonstrates regimes of electrolyte mechanical properties where amplification of surface roughness can be inhibited. For a polymer material with Poisson's ratio similar to poly(ethylene oxide), interfacial roughening is mechanically suppressed when the separator shear modulus is about twice that of lithium. \textcopyright{} 2005 The Electrochemical Society.

In solid states, exciplexes exhibit extraordinary characteristics, including broad emission spectra, multiexponential photoluminescence (PL) decay curves, and spectral red shifts as time delays in transient PL. Here, we present experimental and theoretical evidence that all of the emission characteristics of solid-state exciplexes originate from differences in their dimer configurations, which have different charge transfer rates, emission energies, singlet\textendash triplet energy gaps, kinetic rate constants, and emitting dipole orientations. This conclusion is based on experimental observations, quantum chemical calculations, and molecular dynamics simulations. These results enabled us to develop a model of the electronic structure of an exciplex in a solid-state medium. This comprehensive model accommodates all of the characteristics of the exciplex and can be used to further our understanding of OLEDs and OPVs.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: The feasibility of a practical solid-state technology for low photon flux imaging applications was investigated. The technology is based on an amorphous selenium photoreceptor with a voltage-controlled avalanche multiplication gain. If this photoreceptor can provide sufficient internal gain, it will be useful for an extensive range of diagnostic imaging systems. METHODS: The avalanche photoreceptor under investigation is referred to as HARP-DRL. This is a novel concept in which a high-gain avalanche rushing photoconductor (HARP) is integrated with a distributed resistance layer (DRL) and sandwiched between two electrodes. The avalanche gain and leakage current characteristics of this photoreceptor were measured. RESULTS: HARP-DRL has been found to sustain very high electric field strengths without electrical breakdown. It has shown avalanche multiplication gains as high as 10(4) and a very low leakage current (\textbackslash textless or = 20 pA/mm2). CONCLUSIONS: This is the first experimental demonstration of a solid-state amorphous photoreceptor which provides sufficient internal avalanche gain for photon counting and photon starved imaging applications.},

The mixing properties of the various REE garnet components are calculated from these endmember thermodynamic data and the interionic static potential model developed earlier for major silicate garnet components. These results permit evaluation of the solubility behavior for REE in natural phases. The results suggest that the mixing of REE garnet components at trace level (i.e., below about 102 ppm) with major silicate garnet components is virtually ideal, but strong positive deviations, associated with generalized polyhedral distortion of the host phase at higher concentration level of the solute, prevent bulk REE solubility from exceeding a few hundreds ppm. The computed rare earth element fractionations between garnet and supercritical fluid at various P, T conditions put in evidence the main control operated by the intrinsic energy properties of REE-garnet end members in determining the light REE/heavy REE (LREE/HREE) fractionation observed in natural garnet specimens.},

Both experimental and theoretical data indicate that although both anti and gauche conformers are possible by rotating about the S-S bond, the preferred conformation is gauche. The barrier to internal rotation in the CSSC skeleton has been calculated using the RHF/6-31G(d), MP2/6-31G(d), and B3LYP/6-31G(d) methods as well as MP2 with a 6-31G(3df) basis set on sulfur and 6-31G(d) on C, H, and O. A 6-fold decomposition of the rotational barrier has been performed in terms of a Fourier-type expansion, enabling us to analyze the nature of the potential function, showing that the coefficients V1 and V2 are the dominant terms; V1 is associated with nonbonding interactions, and V2 is associated with hyperconjugative interactions. A natural bond orbital analysis showed that the lone pair \textendash\textbackslash textgreater sigma* hyperconjugative interactions favor the gauche conformation. Furthermore, the infrared spectra for the liquid and solid phases and the Raman spectrum for the liquid have been recorded, and the observed bands have been assigned to the vibrational normal modes. The experimental vibrational data, along with calculated theoretical force constants, were used to define a scaled quantum mechanical force field for the target system that enabled us to estimate the measured frequencies with a final root-mean-square deviation of 6 cm-1.},

The three-dimensional structure and the conduction pathways of Li ions in (Li2S)5(GeS2)(P2S5) glass were visualized by combining reverse Monte Carlo (RMC) modeling and the bond valence sum (BVS) approach. The electrochemical properties were characterized; the material demonstrated an electrical conductivity, {$\sigma$}300K, of 1.5\texttimes 10-5S/cm at 300K and an activation energy, Ea, of 55kJ/mol. In addition, it was found that the most advanced lithium-ion conductor, Li10GeP2S12 crystal ({$\sigma$}300K=1.2\texttimes 10-2S/cm and Ea=24kJ/mol), could be obtained by aging the (Li2S)5(GeS2)(P2S5) glass at 803K. By comparing the conduction pathways of Li ions in (Li2S)5(GeS2)(P2S5) glass with those in Li10GeP2S12 crystal, we found that |{$\Delta$}V(Li)|max, the maximum BV mismatch value for Li ions, for (Li2S)5(GeS2)(P2S5) glass (|{$\Delta$}V(Li)|max=0.13) was significantly larger than that for Li10GeP2S12 crystal (|{$\Delta$}V(Li)|max=0.03). This indicates that the potential barrier, Ea, for Li ions moving along the conduction pathways lowers on the transition from (Li2S)5(GeS2)(P2S5) glass to Li10GeP2S12 crystal. Here, we propose that the lowering of the |{$\Delta$}V(Li)|max is the reason for the structural origin of the massive improvement in {$\sigma$}300K and Ea during the glass-to-crystal transition.},

The band gap of InGaN alloys as a function of In content is calculated and a strong bowing at low In content is found, described by bowing parameters 2.29 eV at 6.25\% and 1.79 eV at 12.5\%, indicating the band gap cannot be described by a single composition-independent bowing parameter. Valence-band maxima (VBM) and conduction-band minima (CBM) are aligned by combining bulk calculations with surface calculations for nonpolar surfaces. The influence of surface termination [(1100) m-plane or (1120) a-plane] is thoroughly investigated. We find that for the relaxed surfaces of the binary nitrides the difference in electron affinities between m- and a-plane is less than 0.1 eV. The absolute electron affinities are found to strongly depend on the choice of XC functional. However, we find that relative alignments are less sensitive to the choice of XC functional. In particular, we find that relative alignments may be calculated based on Perdew-Becke-Ernzerhof [J. P. Perdew, K. Burke, and M. Ernzerhof, Phys. Rev. Lett. 134, 3865 (1996)] surface calculations with the HSE06 lattice parameters. For InGaN we find that the VBM is a linear function of In content and that the majority of the band-gap bowing is located in the CBM. Based on the calculated electron affinities we predict that InGaN will be suited for water splitting up to 50\% In content.},

We find the mobility of electrons to be in the range 5-10 cm(2)V(-1)s(-1) and that for holes within 1-5 cm(2)V(-1)s(-1), where the variations depend on the crystal structure investigated and the level of doping. Such results, in good agreement with recent experiments, set the relaxation time to about 1 ps, which is the time-scale for the molecular rotation at room temperature. For the room temperature tetragonal phase we explore two possible orientations of the organic cations and find that the mobility has a significant asymmetry depending on the direction of the current with respect to the molecular axis. This is due mostly to the way the PbI3 octahedral symmetry is broken. Interestingly we find that substituting I with Cl has minor effects on the mobilities. Our analysis suggests that the carrier mobility is probably not a key factor in determining the high solar-harvesting efficiency of this class of materials.},

To evaluate lithium mobility, we calculate the activation energies for lithium diffusion through the known tavorite cathode materials LiVO(PO4), LiV(PO4)F, and LiFe(SO4)F. Our calculations indicate that tavorite-structured materials are capable of very high rates of one-dimensional lithium diffusion, and several tavorite-structured materials may be capable of reversibly inserting two lithium ions per redox-active metal.},

We also corroborate the feasibility of ion exchange reactions as a suitable synthetic approach towards magnesium electrolytes which do not contain the cation (Mg2(m- Cl)3\$6THF)+. Our results indicate that magnesium organoborates are an interesting class of magnesium electrolytes which undergo magnesium deposition and dissolution and are non-corrosive in nature at high voltages.}

The study has been complemented with differential scanning calorimeter DSC, dc susceptibility and magnetization measurements. Although the refinement of the crystal structure from NPD data is possible in the orthorhombic Pnma and Ima2 space groups, the support of ab-initio band-structure calculations has allowed us to select, without ambiguity, the Ima2 space group as the ground state for SrCoO2.5 brownmillerite. In Ima2 the crystallographic structure of SrCoO2.5 is described as layers of corner-sharing Co1O6 octahedra alternating along the a axis with layers of vertex-sharing Co2O4 tetrahedra, conforming chains running along the 0 0 1 direction. The magnetic structure below TN=537 K is G-type with the magnetic moments directed along the c axis. This magnetic arrangement is stable from TN down to 10 K.At T=10 K, the magnetic moment values for Co1 and Co2 atoms are 3.1213B and 2.8814B, respectively, compatible with a Co2+L state, where L stands for a ligand hole. The magnetic susceptibility curves show, below 200 K, a divergence of zero-field cooling and field cooling curves, displaying broad maxima which are interpreted as due to the presence of ferromagnetic clusters embedded into an antiferromagnetic matrix. These inhomogeneities are inherent to the synthesis process, by quenching microcrystalline samples of SrCoO3-x composition from high temperature, where cubic, ferromagnetic perovskites have been identified by diffraction methods.}

We have examined Li migration in spinels LiMn(2)O(4), LiCo(2)O(4), and LiCo(1/16)Mn(15/16)O(4) by means of first-principles calculations based on density functional theory (DFT). The results showed that the trajectory of the Li jump was straight between the two adjacent Li ions for all of the three spinel compounds. However, there were significant differences in the energy profiles and the Li jump path for LiMn(2)O(4) and LiCo(2)O(4). For LiMn(2)O(4) the highest energy barrier was in the middle of the two tetrahedral sites, or in the octahedral vacancy (16c). For LiCo(2)O(4) the lowest energy was around the octahedral 16c site and the energy barrier was located at the bottleneck sites. The difference in the energy profile for LiCo(2)O(4) stemmed from the charge disproportion of Co(3.5+) to Co(3+)/Co(4+) caused by a Li vacancy forming and jumping, which was not observed for LiMn(2)O(4). Charge disproportion successfully accounted for the faster Li migration mechanism observed in LiCo(1/16)Mn(15/16)O(4). Our computational results demonstrate the importance of the effect of charge distribution on the ion jump.},

Providing that the solubility of the starting complex is sufficiently high, all the components of the coordination polymer, namely the anion, the cation and the ligand, can be exchanged on contact with a solution phase of a competing component. The solubility of coordination polymers is a key factor in the analysis of their reactivity and this solubility depends strongly on the physical properties of the solvent and on its ability to bind metal cations constituting the backbone of the coordination polymer. The degree of reversibility of these solvent-induced anion-exchange transformations is determined by the ratio of the solubility product constants for the starting and resultant complexes, which in turn depend upon the choice of solvent and the temperature. The extent of anion exchange is controlled effectively by the ratio of the concentrations of incoming ions to outgoing ions in the liquid phase and the solvation of various constituent components comprising the coordination polymer. These observations can be rationalised in terms of a dynamic equilibrium of ion exchange reactions coupled with Ostwald ripening of crystalline products.

Early work consisted of heuristic rules-of-thumb or structure maps using descriptors that were obtained largely by inspection. Increasingly, these approaches are being expanded to use descriptors that have been obtained by applying machine learning techniques to big data containing information from the experiment and/or first principles calculations. Improved techniques for global optimization in the multi-dimensional coordinate space have also led to major advances in the field.},

The luminescence mechanism and peculiar temperature dependence of bands intensities are discussed on the basis of the crystal field theory (within the exchange charge model) combined with the vibronic approach. The latter involves the electron vibrational interaction in two kinds of the Eu2+ centers as well as the interaction between these centers in the host lattice. A simplified single-mode model was adopted for each center and the section of the bi-dimensional adiabatic potential of the Eu2+ dimer along an effective ``out-of-phase mode'' is considered. This original approach qualitatively explains the temperature dependence of the emission bands intensities by the non-radiative redistribution of excitations between two neighboring Eu2+ centers occupying two crystallographically different Sr positions in the SrAl2O4 lattice .},

  abstract = {The widely accepted intuition that the important properties of solids are determined by a few key variables underpins many methods in physics. Though this reductionist paradigm is applicable in many physical problems, its utility can be limited because the intuition for identifying the key variables often does not exist or is difficult to develop. Machine learning algorithms (genetic programming, neural networks, Bayesian methods, etc.) attempt to eliminate the a priori need for such intuition but often do so with increased computational burden and human time. A recently developed technique in the field of signal processing, compressive sensing (CS), provides a simple, general, and efficient way of finding the key descriptive variables. CS is a powerful paradigm for model building; we show that its models are more physical and predict more accurately than current state-of-the-art approaches and can be constructed at a fraction of the computational cost and user effort.},

  abstract = {\textcopyright{} 2017 American Chemical Society. Solar-driven oxygen evolution is a critical technology for renewably synthesizing hydrogen- and carbon-containing fuels in solar fuel generators. New photoanode materials are needed to meet efficiency and stability requirements, motivating materials explorations for semiconductors with (i) band-gap energy in the visible spectrum and (ii) stable operation in aqueous electrolyte at the electrochemical potential needed to evolve oxygen from water. Motivated by the oxygen evolution competency of many Mn-based oxides, the existence of several Bi-containing ternary oxide photoanode materials, and the variety of known oxide materials combining these elements with Sm, we explore the Bi-Mn-Sm oxide system for new photoanodes. Through the use of a ferri/ferrocyanide redox couple in high-throughput screening, BiMn 2 O 5 and its alloy with Sm are identified as photoanode materials with a near-ideal optical band gap of 1.8 eV. Using density functional theory-based calculations of the mullite Bi 3+ Mn 3+ Mn 4+ O 5 phase, we identify electronic analogues to the well-known BiVO 4 photoanode and demonstrate excellent Pourbaix stability above the oxygen evolution Nernstian potential from pH 4.5 to 15. Our suite of experimental and computational characterization indicates that BiMn 2 O 5 is a complex oxide with the necessary optical and chemical properties to be an efficient, stable solar fuel photoanode.},

From these analyses it was found that SPS reduced Na3OBr's interfacial impedance by three orders of magnitude, which translated into an increase in the overall ionic conductivity and a reduction in the activation energy, from 1.142 eV to 0.837 eV. DFT was used to probe the mechanisms for ionic transport in Na-rich Na3OBr. The formation energies of ion diffusion-facilitating defects in Na3OBr were found to be much higher compared to the lithium-rich anti-perovskites (LiRAP), which can explain the difference in overall ionic conductivity between the two.},

One method to accelerate scientific discovery is to extract more insight from costly scientific experiments already conducted. Unfortunately, data from scientific experiments tend only to be accessible by the originator who knows the experiments and directives. Moreover, there are no robust methods to search unstructured databases of images to deduce correlations and insight. Here, we develop a machine learning approach to create image similarity projections to search unstructured image databases. To improve these projections, we develop and train a model to include symmetry-aware features. As an exemplar, we use a set of 25,133 piezoresponse force microscopy images collected on diverse materials systems over five years. We demonstrate how this tool can be used for interactive recursive image searching and exploration, highlighting structural similarities at various length scales. This tool justifies continued investment in federated scientific databases with standardized metadata schemas where the combination of filtering and recursive interactive searching can uncover synthesis-structure-property relations. We provide a customizable open-source package (               https://github.com/m3-learning/Recursive\_Symmetry\_Aware\_Materials\_Microstructure\_Explorer               ) of this interactive tool for researchers to use with their data.},

Here, for the first time, a Li3VO4 anode is reported with reversible capacity approaching the theoretical value. Li3VO4 aggregates hybridized with carbon (Li3VO4/C) are first fabricated, and then dramatically transform into well dispersed Li3VO4 nanocrystals (NCs) anchoring on carbon nanoflakes (NFs) by electrochemical reconstruction. In the Li3VO4/C NC-on-NF structures, the small-sized Li3VO4 NCs, the flexible carbon NFs, and the good dispersity provide high Li-ion storage, electronic conductivity and stability, respectively. Resultingly, outstanding electrochemical performance of the Li3VO4/C is achieved with discharge and charge capacities of 542 and 541 mAh g-1 after 300 cycles at a specific current of 150 mA g-1. After 1000 cycles at a specific current of 2000 mA g-1, the discharge and charge capacities are maintained at 422 and 421 mAh g-1. When matching with a 4 V cathode, the specific energy density of the Li3VO4/C is 4.2 times of Li4Ti5O12 and 1.2 times of graphite, and the volumetric energy density is 3.2 times of Li4Ti5O12 and 1.4 times of graphite.}

The results show that citrate strongly and selectively adsorbs to the (0001) face. Similarly, results show that ethylenediamine selectively adsorbs to the (1010) face. Each of these results separately shows a correlation between selective adsorption to and growth of large areas of a particular face, and thus, each result is consistent with the proposed hypothesis.},

  abstract = {Efficient sampling of equilibrium states Molecular dynamics or Monte Carlo methods can be used to sample equilibrium states, but these methods become computationally expensive for complex systems, where the transition from one equilibrium state to another may only occur through rare events. No\'e et al. used neural networks and deep learning to generate distributions of independent soft condensed-matter samples at equilibrium (see the Perspective by Tuckerman). Supervised training is used to construct invertible transformations between the coordinates of the complex system of interest and simple Gaussian coordinates of the same dimensionality. Thus, configurations can be sampled in this simpler coordinate system and then transformed back into the complex one using the correct statistical weighting. Science, this issue p. eaaw1147; see also p. 982 Structured Abstract INTRODUCTIONStatistical mechanics aims to compute the average behavior of physical systems on the basis of their microscopic constituents. For example, what is the probability that a protein will be folded at a given temperature? If we could answer such questions efficiently, then we could not only comprehend the workings of molecules and materials, but we could also design drug molecules and materials with new properties in a principled way.To this end, we need to compute statistics of the equilibrium states of many-body systems. In the protein-folding example, this means to consider each of the astronomically many ways to place all protein atoms in space, to compute the probability of each such ``configuration'' in the equilibrium ensemble, and then to compare the total probability of unfolded and folded configurations.As enumeration of all configurations is infeasible, one instead must attempt to sample them from their equilibrium distribution. However, we currently have no way to generate equilibrium samples of many-body systems in ``one shot.'' The main approach is thus to start with one configuration, e.g., the folded protein state, and make tiny changes to it over time, e.g., by using Markov-chain Monte Carlo or molecular dynamics (MD). However, these simulations get trapped in metastable (long-lived) states: For example, sampling a single folding or unfolding event with atomistic MD may take a year on a supercomputer. RATIONALEHere, we combine deep machine learning and statistical mechanics to develop Boltzmann generators. Boltzmann generators are trained on the energy function of a many-body system and learn to provide unbiased, one-shot samples from its equilibrium state. This is achieved by training an invertible neural network to learn a coordinate transformation from a system's configurations to a so-called latent space representation, in which the low-energy configurations of different states are close to each other and can be easily sampled. Because of the invertibility, every latent space sample can be back-transformed to a system configuration with high Boltzmann probability (Fig. 1). We then employ statistical mechanics, which offers a rich set of tools for reweighting the distribution generated by the neural network to the Boltzmann distribution. RESULTSBoltzmann generators can be trained to directly generate independent samples of low-energy structures of condensed-matter systems and protein molecules. When initialized with a few structures from different metastable states, Boltzmann generators can generate statistically independent samples from these states and efficiently compute the free-energy differences between them. This capability could be used to compute relative stabilities between different experimental structures of protein or other organic molecules, which is currently a very challenging problem. Boltzmann generators can also learn a notion of ``reaction coordinates'': Simple linear interpolations between points in latent space have a high probability of corresponding to physically realistic, low-energy transition pathways. Finally, by using established sampling methods such as Metropolis Monte Carlo in the latent space variables, Boltzmann generators can discover new states and gradually explore state space. CONCLUSIONBoltzmann generators can overcome rare event\textendash sampling problems in many-body systems by learning to generate unbiased equilibrium samples from different metastable states in one shot. They differ conceptually from established enhanced sampling methods, as no reaction coordinates are needed to drive them between metastable states. However, by applying existing sampling methods in the latent spaces learned by Boltzmann generators, a plethora of new opportunities opens up to design efficient sampling methods for many-body systems. {$<$}img class="fragment-image" aria-describedby="F1-caption" src="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/sci/365/6457/eaaw1147/F1.medium.gif"/{$>$} Download high-res image Open in new tab Download Powerpoint Boltzmann generators overcome sampling problems between long-lived states.The Boltzmann generator works as follows: 1.

To compute thermodynamics quantities, the samples are reweighted to the Boltzmann distribution using statistical mechanics methods. Computing equilibrium states in condensed-matter many-body systems, such as solvated proteins, is a long-standing challenge. Lacking methods for generating statistically independent equilibrium samples in ``one shot,'' vast computational effort is invested for simulating these systems in small steps, e.g., using molecular dynamics. Combining deep learning and statistical mechanics, we developed Boltzmann generators, which are shown to generate unbiased one-shot equilibrium samples of representative condensed-matter systems and proteins. Boltzmann generators use neural networks to learn a coordinate transformation of the complex configurational equilibrium distribution to a distribution that can be easily sampled. Accurate computation of free-energy differences and discovery of new configurations are demonstrated, providing a statistical mechanics tool that can avoid rare events during sampling without prior knowledge of reaction coordinates. By combining deep learning and statistical mechanics, neural networks sample the equilibrium distribution of many-body systems.

This work presents a framework for learning a continuous representation of materials and building a model for new discovery using latent space representation. The ability of autoencoders to generate experimental materials is demonstrated with vanadium oxides via rediscovery of experimentally known structures when the model was trained without them. Approximately 20,000 hypothetical materials are generated, leading to several completely new metastable VxOy materials that may be synthesizable. Comparison with genetic algorithms suggests computational efficiency of generative models that can explore chemical compositional space effectively by learning the distributions of known materials for crystal structure prediction. These results are an important step toward machine-learned inverse design of inorganic functional materials using generative models.},

Until recently, exploration of materials space using chemical intuitions built upon existing materials has been the general strategy, but this direct design approach is often time and resource consuming and poses a significant bottleneck to solve the materials challenges of future sustainability in a timely manner. To accelerate this conventional design process, inverse design, which outputs materials with pre-defined target properties, has emerged as a significant materials informatics platform in recent years by leveraging hidden knowledge obtained from materials data. Here, we summarize the latest progress in machine-enabled inverse materials design categorized into three strategies: high-throughput virtual screening, global optimization, and generative models. We analyze challenges for each approach and discuss gaps to be bridged for further accelerated and rational data-driven materials design.},

  abstract = {Background: A frequent problem in computational modeling is the interconversion of chemical structures between different formats. While standard interchange formats exist (for example, Chemical Markup Language) and de facto standards have arisen (for example, SMILES format), the need to interconvert formats is a continuing problem due to the multitude of different application areas for chemistry data, differences in the data stored by different formats (0D versus 3D, for example), and competition between software along with a lack of vendorneutral formats. Results: We discuss, for the first time, Open Babel, an open-source chemical toolbox that speaks the many languages of chemical data. Open Babel version 2.3 interconverts over 110 formats. The need to represent such a wide variety of chemical and molecular data requires a library that implements a wide range of cheminformatics algorithms, from partial charge assignment and aromaticity detection, to bond order perception and canonicalization. We detail the implementation of Open Babel, describe key advances in the 2.3 release, and outline a variety of uses both in terms of software products and scientific research, including applications far beyond simple format interconversion. Conclusions: Open Babel presents a solution to the proliferation of multiple chemical file formats. In addition, it provides a variety of useful utilities from conformer searching and 2D depiction, to filtering, batch conversion, and substructure and similarity searching. For developers, it can be used as a programming library to handle chemical data in areas such as organic chemistry, drug design, materials science, and computational chemistry.

They behave as expected for anionic O charge order compounds with trends to subperoxide quantization O1-2qq. Optimized superconducting Tc are predictable as 666 K/q reflecting harmonics of the interaction of polaron patterns with the crystal structure. Absence of Tc is due to O- preferential site occupation. For complex cuprates (e.g., based on M=Bi, Hg\textbackslash ldots) observed Tc are higher than predicted by characteristic stoichiometric factors indicating that M can undergo quantized reductive cell volume (V) expanding selfdoping to achieve specific q. Trends to Tc plateaus, maximum doping tolerance, V expansion effects and stratified tolerance factor adjustments with temperature become understandable as due to a quantized subperoxide web. Moreover, the principle of fractional valency selfbonding depicts these materials as electron compounds and points generally a way to an understanding of structural and superconducting properties of related metallic systems.},

The light output under X-ray or {$\gamma$}-ray excitation is, however, well below the theoretical limit. In this paper the influence of codoping with Tb(3+) is investigated with the aim to increase the light output. High resolution spectra of singly doped LuAG (with Ce(3+) or Tb(3+)) are reported and provide insight into the energy level structure of the two ions in LuAG. For Ce(3+) zero-phonon lines and vibronic structure are observed for the two lowest energy 5d bands and the Stokes' shift (2 350 cm(-1)) and Huang-Rhys coupling parameter (S = 9) have been determined. Tb(3+) 4f-5d transitions to the high spin (HS) and low spin (LS) states are observed (including a zero-phonon line and vibrational structure for the high spin state). The HS-LS splitting of 5400 cm(-1) is smaller than usually observed and is explained by a reduction of the 5d-4f exchange coupling parameter J by covalency. Upon replacing the smaller Lu(3+) ion with the larger Tb(3+) ion, the crystal field splitting for the lowest 5d states increases, causing the lowest 5d state to shift below the (5)D(4) state of Tb(3+) and allowing for efficient energy transfer from Tb(3+) to Ce(3+) down to the lowest temperatures. Luminescence decay measurements confirm efficient energy transfer from Tb(3+) to Ce(3+) and provide a qualitative understanding of the energy transfer process. Co-doping with Tb(3+) does not result in the desired increase in light output, and an explanation based on electron trapping in defects is discussed.},

These configurations were then used for revealing the distributions of La and Li ions and to understand the relationship between these distributions and ionic conduction. An alternating arrangement of La-rich and La-poor layers along the c-axis was found in the x = 0.075 composition. Intriguingly, this arrangement has gradually disappeared in samples with higher Li concentration. Furthermore, RMC models exhibit disordered distributions of Li ions, situated mainly on the La-rich layer, and there is a significant probability of Li ions occupying the interstitial sites (T site) between the O-3 triangle plane of the TiO6 octahedron and an La ion or its vacancy site. It was also found on the basis of the RMC models that the bond valence sum (BVS) for Li ions behaves differently on La-rich and La-poor layers at low Li concentration compositions, but they are similar at high Li concentration compositions. This is consistent with the behaviour of the alternating arrangement of La-rich and La-poor layers. It is also suggested that the Li ions around the bottleneck at (1/2, 0, 0) (bottom layer) can jump to an adjacent bottleneck at (0, 1/2, 0) through the T site and not only Li ions in the La-poor layers but also Li ions in the La-rich layers contribute to the bottleneck\textendash bottleneck Li conduction.},

The easy ion exchange of Na+ by bigger cations (such as K+, Rb+ and Cs+) and the existence of the oxidized species Zn3[FeIII(CN)6]2 (as a stable phase) support the present study of the redox reaction and stability in aqueous media under electrochemical conditions for all the series, including the effect of the accompanying cation on the mobility of sodium in the framework. When a study was carried out in a solution of sodium ions, in the material structure K+ and Rb+ were progressively displaced by the sodium ions, which was ascribed to their higher mobility. However, when an experiment was conducted using a solution containing Cs+ or in an aqueous solution of NaNO3, from Zn3Cs2[FeII(CN)6]2, the mixed composition Zn3NaCs[FeII(CN)6]2 was formed. The results discussed here are supported by the electrochemical and spectroscopic measurements. Galvanostatic experiments on the Zn3Cs2[FeII(CN)6]2 system in a solution of sodium ions revealed a capacity retention of 75\% during 40 charge/discharge cycles.},

  abstract = {A method to predict the crystal structure of equiatomic ternary compositions based only on the constituent elements was developed using cluster resolution feature selection (CR-FS) and support vector machine (SVM) classification. The supervised machine-learning model was first trained with 1037 individual compounds that adopt the most populated ternary 1:1:1 structure types (TiNiSi-, ZrNiAl-, PbFCl-, LiGaGe-, YPtAs-, UGeTe-, and LaPtSi-type) and then validated using an additional 519 compounds. The CR-FS algorithm improves class discrim-ination and indicates that 113 variables including size, electronegativity, number of valence electrons, and position on the periodic table (group number) influence the structure preference. The final model prediction sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy were 97.3\%, 93.9\%, and 96.9\%, respectively, establishing that this method is capable of reliably predicting the crystal structure given only its composition. The power of CR-FS and SVM classification is further demonstrated by segregating the crystal structure of polymorphs, specifically to examine polymorphism in TiNiSi-and ZrNiAl-type structures. Analyzing 19 compositions that are experimentally reported in both structure types, this machine-learning model correctly identifies, with high confidence (\textbackslash textgreater0.7), the low-temperature polymorph from its high-temperature form. Interestingly, machine learning also reveals that certain compositions cannot be clearly differentiated and lie in a " confused " region (0.3-0.7 confidence), suggesting that both polymorphs may be observed in a single sample at certain experimental conditions. The ensuing synthesis and characterization of TiFeP adopting both TiNiSi-and ZrNiAl-type structures in a single sample, even after long annealing times (3 months), validate the occurrence of the region of structural uncertainty predicted by machine learning.},

  abstract = {The maximum voltage that can be used in electroanalytical experiments and electrochemical devices such as supercapacitors is limited by the electrochemical window within which the solvent and electrolyte resist decomposition. In the absence of a better definition, the limits of this window have been typically defined as the potentials at which a current density of an arbitrary value is achieved, which leads to inconsistencies between values from different sources. We propose a more useful definition of the electrochemical limits that depends less on experimental parameters, permitting more meaningful comparison of data from different investigators. The new method introduced here defines the electrochemical limit as the intercept of the approximately linear portions of the current\textendash voltage relationship at potentials below and above the onset of electrochemical electrolyte or solvent decomposition, as determined by linear sweep voltammetry. To demonstrate the usefulness of this definition, we show that its use nearly eliminates the concentration dependence of the electrochemical limit caused by reduction of tetrabutylammonium perchlorate, and that it minimizes the extent to which the electrochemical limit due to tetraalkylammonium ion reduction depends on the length of the alkyl groups.},

All interion interactions were taken into account by explicitly modeling the entire liquid structure using classical MD, followed by DFT computations of the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energies. The relative cathodic and anodic limits of BMIM PF6, BMIM BF4, BMIM TFSI, and P13 TFSI obtained from our approach are in fairly good agreement with existing experimental data. From our DFT calculations, we also obtained the cation- and anion-projected density of states (DOS), which provide information on the likely species contributing to reductive and oxidative decomposition. Our predictions support Howlett et al.'s earlier finding1 that the TFSI anion is less stable than the P13 cation against reduction. In addition, our results provide surprising evidence of possible cation anodic instability; we predict the aromatic BMIM cation to be less stable against oxidation than the respective anions in BMIM PF6 and BMIM BF4, and the P13 cation to be less stable against oxidation than the PF6 anion in P13 PF6. We also present a comparison of the predictions of our approach with that of simpler approximations based on in vacuo or polarizable continuum model calculations.},

Over 200 unique cations and anions, formed from a set of six base cation structures, three base anion structures, and seven functional groups, were investigated.We find the trends in calculated EAs of alkylated cations and IEs of alkylated anions to be in good agreement with observed experimental trends in relative cathodic and anodic stabilities of various ILs. In addition, we also investigated the effect that functional group substitution at distinct positions in the ions have on the EA of the 1,2,3-trimethylimidazolium cation and the IE of the PF5CF3 anion. The overall impact on the EA or IE can be explained by the known electron-donating and electron-withdrawing inductive and resonance effects of the attached functional group, and the relative strength of the effect depends on the substitution position.},

Our study finds migration barriers for the free polaron to be between 68 and 152 meV, depending on the hopping direction. This low barrier suggests that this material might not be as insulating as previously assumed, provided that the formation of carriers can be achieved. One transport limitation may arise from lithium vacancies, which we find to strongly bind to the polaron. This result, in combination with previous experimental results, suggests that electronic conductivity in this material is likely to be determined by vacancy diffusion.},

The Li10GeP2S12 (LGPS) superionic conductor has the highest Li+ conductivity reported to date, with excellent electrochemical performance demonstrated in a Li-ion rechargeable battery. Our results show that isovalent cation substitutions of Ge4+ have a small effect on the relevant intrinsic properties, with Li10SiP2S12 and Li10SnP2S12 having similar phase stability, electrochemical stability and Li+ conductivity as LGPS. Aliovalent cation substitutions (M = Al or P) with compensating changes in Li+ concentration also have a small effect on the Li+ conductivity in this structure. Anion substitutions, however, have a much larger effect on these properties. The oxygen-substituted Li10MP2O12 compounds are in general predicted not to be stable (with equilibrium decomposition energies \textbackslash textgreater 90 meV/atom) and have much lower Li+ conductivities than their sulphide counterparts. The selenium-substituted Li10MP2Se12 compounds, on the other hand, show a marginal improvement in conductivity, but at the expense of reduced electrochemical stability. We also studied the effect of lattice parameter changes on the Li+ conductivity and found the same asymmetry in behavior between increases and decreases in the lattice parameters, i.e., decreases in the lattice parameters lower the Li+ conductivity significantly, while increases in the lattice parameters increase the Li+ conductivity only marginally. Based on these results, we conclude that the size of the S2- is near optimal for Li+ conduction in this structural framework.},

A key enabler in high-throughput computational materials science efforts is a robust set of software tools to perform initial setup for the calculations (e.g., generation of structures and necessary input files) and post-calculation analysis to derive useful material properties from raw calculated data. The pymatgen library aims to meet these needs by (1) defining core Python objects for materials data representation, (2) providing a well-tested set of structure and thermodynamic analyses relevant to many applications, and (3) establishing an open platform for researchers to collaboratively develop sophisticated analyses of materials data obtained both from first principles calculations and experiments. The pymatgen library also provides convenient tools to obtain useful materials data via the Materials Project's REpresentational State Transfer (REST) Application Programming Interface (API). As an example, using pymatgen's interface to the Materials Project's RESTful API and phasediagram package, we demonstrate how the phase and electrochemical stability of a recently synthesized material, Li 4SnS4, can be analyzed using a minimum of computing resources. We find that Li4SnS4 is a stable phase in the Li-Sn-S phase diagram (consistent with the fact that it can be synthesized), but the narrow range of lithium chemical potentials for which it is predicted to be stable would suggest that it is not intrinsically stable against typical electrodes used in lithium-ion batteries. ?? 2012 Elsevier B.V.

The compounds investigated comprise the layered AMO2 and AMS2 structures, the olivine and maricite AMPO4 structures, and the NASICON A3V2(PO4)3 structures. The calculated Na voltages for the compounds investigated are 0.18\textendash 0.57 V lower than that of the corresponding Li voltages, in agreement with previous experimental data. We believe the observed lower voltages for Na compounds are predominantly a cathodic effect related to the much smaller energy gain from inserting Na into the host structure compared to inserting Li. We also found a relatively strong dependence of battery properties on structural features. In general, the difference between the Na and Li voltage of the same structure, DVNa\textendash Li, is less negative for the maricite structures preferred by Na, and more negative for the olivine structures preferred by Li. The layered compounds have the most negative DVNa\textendash Li. In terms of phase stability, we found that open structures, such as the layered and NASICON structures, that are better able to accommodate the larger Na+ ion generally have both Na and Li versions of the same compound. For the close-packed AMPO4 structures, our results show that Na generally prefers the maricite structure, while Li prefers the olivine structure, in agreement with previous experimental work. We also found surprising evidence that the barriers for Na+ migration can potentially be lower than that for Li+ migration in the layered structures. Overall, our findings indicate that Na-ion systems can be competitive with Li-ion systems.},

The valence and the high or low spin states of the Co and Fe ions, as well as the lattice distortion and the band gap, depend on the oxygen deficiency, on the locations of the vacancies, and on the direction of the Fe-Co axis. A charge redistribution that resembles a self-regulatory response lies behind the valence spin-state changes. Ferromagnetism dominates, and both the magnetization and the band gap are greatest at {$\delta$} = 0.125. This qualitatively mimics the previously reported magnetization measured for SrTiFeO3-{$\delta$}, which was maximum at an intermediate deposition pressure of oxygen.},

Control of the interfaces between materials with the same crystal structures but different chemical compositions is possible in many materials classes, but less progress has been made for oxide materials with different crystal structures. We show that dynamical self-organization during growth can create a coherent interface between the perovskite and fluorite oxide structures, which are based on different structural motifs, if an appropriate choice of cations is made to enable this restructuring. The integration of calculation with experimental observation reveals that the interface differs from both the bulk components and identifies the chemical bonding requirements to connect distinct oxide structures.},

  abstract = {The semiconductor ZnO has gained substantial interest in the research community in part because of its large exciton binding energy 60 meV which could lead to lasing action based on exciton recombination even above room temperature. Even though research focusing on ZnO goes back many decades, the renewed interest is fueled by availability of high-quality substrates and reports of p-type conduction and ferromagnetic behavior when doped with transitions metals, both of which remain controversial. It is this renewed interest in ZnO which forms the basis of this review. As mentioned already, ZnO is not new to the semiconductor field, with studies of its lattice parameter dating back to 1935 by Bunn Proc. Phys. Soc. London 47, 836 1935, studies of its vibrational properties with Raman scattering in 1966 by Damen et al. Phys. Rev. 142, 570 1966, detailed optical studies in 1954 by Mollwo Z. Angew. Phys. 6, 257 1954, and its growth by chemical-vapor transport in 1970 by Galli and Coker Appl. Phys. Lett. 16, 439 1970. In terms of devices, Au Schottky barriers in 1965 by Mead Phys. Lett. 18, 218 1965, demonstration of light-emitting diodes 1967 by Drapak Semiconductors 2, 624 1968, in which Cu2O was used as the p-type material, metal-insulator-semiconductor structures 1974 by Minami et al. Jpn. J. Appl. Phys. 13, 1475 1974, ZnO/ZnSe n-p junctions 1975 by Tsurkan et al. Semiconductors 6, 1183 1975, and Al/Au Ohmic contacts by Brillson J. Vac. Sci. Technol. 15, 1378 1978 were attained. The main obstacle to the development of ZnO has been the lack of reproducible and low-resistivity p-type ZnO, as recently discussed by Look and Claflin Phys. Status Solidi B 241, 624 2004. While ZnO already has many industrial applications owing to its piezoelectric properties and band gap in the near ultraviolet, its applications to optoelectronic devices has not yet materialized due chiefly to the lack of p-type epitaxial layers. Very high quality what used to be called whiskers and platelets, the nomenclature for which gave way to nanostructures of late, have been prepared early on and used to deduce much of the principal properties of this material, particularly in terms of optical processes. The suggestion of attainment of p-type conductivity in the last few years has rekindled the long-time, albeit dormant, fervor of exploiting this material for optoelectronic applications. The attraction can simply be attributed to the large exciton binding energy of 60 meV of ZnO potentially paving the way for efficient room-temperature exciton-based emitters, and sharp transitions facilitating very low threshold semiconductor lasers. The field is also fueled by theoretical predictions and perhaps experimental confirmation of ferromagnetism at room temperature for potential spintronics applications. This review gives an in-depth discussion of the mechanical, chemical, electrical, and optical properties of ZnO in addition to the technological issues such as growth, defects, p-type doping, band-gap engineering, devices, and nanostructures.},

(i) Our theoretical calculations correctly reproduce the tendencies of Ag-Au and Cu-Au to form compounds and Ni-Au and Cu-Ag to phase separate at T=0 K. (ii) Of all possible structures, Cu/sub 3/Au (L1/sub 2/) and CuAu (L1/sub 0/) are found to be the most stable low-temperature phases of Cu/sub 1-x/Au/sub x/ with transition temperatures of 530 K and 660 K, respectively, compared to the experimental values 663 K and 670 K. The significant improvement over previous first-principles studies is attributed to the more accurate treatment of atomic relaxations in the present work. (iii) LAPW formation enthalpies demonstrate that L1/sub 2/, the commonly assumed stable phase of CuAu/sub 3/, is not the ground state for Au-rich alloys, but rather that ordered \textbackslash textless100\textbackslash textgreater superlattices are stabilized.

For periodic systems, however, the long-range nature of the Fock exchange interaction and the resultant large computational requirements present a major drawback. This is especially true for metallic systems, which require a dense Brillouin zone sampling. Recently, a new hybrid functional [HSE03, J. Heyd, G. E. Scuseria, and M. Ernzerhof, J. Chem. Phys. 118, 8207 (2003)] that addresses this problem within the context of methods that evaluate the Fock exchange in real space was introduced. We discuss the advantages the HSE03 functional brings to methods that rely on a reciprocal space description of the Fock exchange interaction, e.g., all methods that use plane wave basis sets. Furthermore, we present a detailed comparison of the performance of the HSE03 and PBE0 functionals for a set of archetypical solid state systems by calculating lattice parameters, bulk moduli, heats of formation, and band gaps. The results indicate that the hybrid functionals indeed often improve the description of these properties, but in several cases the results are not yet on par with standard gradient corrected functionals. This concerns in particular metallic systems for which the bandwidth and exchange splitting are seriously overestimated.},

  abstract = {The B3LYP hybrid functional has shown to successfully predict a wide range of molecular properties. For periodic systems, however, the failure to attain the exact homogeneous electron gas limit as well as the semiempirical construction turns out to be a major drawback of the functional. We rigorously assess the B3LYP functional for solids through calculations of lattice parameters, bulk moduli, and thermochemical properties (atomization energies and reaction energies). The theoretical lattice constants overestimate the experimental ones by approximately 1\%, and hence behave similarly to the PBE gradient-corrected exchange-correlation functional. B3LYP atomization energies of solids are drastically worse than those of nonempirical hybrid Hartree-Fock/density functionals (HF/DFT) such as PBE0 and HSE03. These large errors can be traced back to the lack of a proper description of "free-electron-like" systems with a significant itinerant character (metals and small gap semiconductors). Similar calculations using the popular semiempirical B3PW91 hybrid functional, which fulfills the uniform electron gas limit, show a clear improvement over B3LYP regarding atomization energies. Finally, theoretical values for heats of formation for both the B3LYP as well as the B3PW91 functionals are presented. These document a most likely fortuitously good agreement with experiment for the B3LYP hybrid functional.},

  abstract = {Energy production and storage have become key issues concerning our welfare in daily life. Present challenges for batteries are twofold. In the first place, the increasing demand for powering systems of portable electronic devices and zero-emission vehicles stimulates research towards high energy and high voltage systems. In the second place, low cost batteries are required in order to advance towards smart electric grids that integrate discontinuous energy flow from renewable sources, optimizing the performance of clean energy sources. Na-ion batteries can be the key for the second point, because of the huge availability of sodium, its low price and the similarity of both Li and Na insertion chemistries. In spite of the lower energy density and voltage of Na-ion based technologies, they can be focused on applications where the weight and footprint requirement is less drastic, such as electrical grid storage. Much work has to be done in the field of Na-ion in order to catch up with Li-ion technology. Cathodic and anodic materials must be optimized, and new electrolytes will be the key point for Na-ion success. This review will gather the up-to-date knowledge about Na-ion battery materials, with the aim of providing a wide view of the systems that have already been explored and a starting point for the new research on this battery technology.}

Through optimization of the electrolyte and binder, the microsized Na 2 Ti 3 O 7 electrode delivers a reversible capacity of 188 mA h g - 1 in 1 M NaFSI/PC electrolyte at a current rate of 0.1C in a voltage range of 0.0\textendash 3.0 V, with sodium alginate as binder. The average Na storage voltage plateau is found at ca. 0.3 V vs. Na + /Na, in good agreement with a fi rst-principles prediction of 0.35 V. The Na storage properties in Na 2 Ti 3 O 7 are investigated from thermodynamic and kinetic aspects. By reducing particle size, the nanosized Na 2 Ti 3 O 7 exhibits much higher capacity, but still with unsatisfi ed cyclic properties. The solid-state interphase layer on Na 2 Ti 3 O 7 electrode is analyzed. A zero-current overpotential related to thermodynamic factors is observed for both nano- and microsized Na 2 Ti 3 O 7 . The electronic structure, Na + ion transport and conductivity are investigated by the combination of fi rst-principles calculation and electrochemical characterizations. On the basis of the vacancy-hopping mechanism, a quasi-3D energy favorable trajectory is proposed for Na 2 Ti 3 O 7 . The Na + ions diffuse between the TiO 6 octahedron layers with pretty low activation energy of 0.186 eV.},

  abstract = {Most of the novel phosphors that appear in the literature are either a variant of well-known materials or a hybrid material consisting of well-known materials. This situation has actually led to intellectual property (IP) complications in industry and several lawsuits have been the result. Therefore, the definition of a novel phosphor for use in light-emitting diodes should be clarified. A recent trend in phosphor-related IP applications has been to focus on the novel crystallographic structure, so that a slight composition variance and/or the hybrid of a well-known material would not qualify from either a scientific or an industrial point of view. In our previous studies, we employed a systematic materials discovery strategy combining heuristics optimization and a high-throughput process to secure the discovery of genuinely novel and brilliant phosphors that would be immediately ready for use in light emitting diodes. Despite such an achievement, this strategy requires further refinement to prove its versatility under any circumstance. To accomplish such demands, we improved our discovery strategy by incorporating an elitism-involved nondominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II) that would guarantee the discovery of truly novel phosphors in the present investigation. Using the improved discovery strategy, we discovered an Eu(2+)-doped AB5X8 (A = Sr or Ba, B = Si and Al, X = O and N) phosphor in an orthorhombic structure (A21am) with lattice parameters a = 9.48461(3) A, b = 13.47194(6) A, c = 5.77323(2) A, alpha = beta = gamma = 90 degrees , which cannot be found in any of the existing inorganic compound databases.},

  abstract = {Argyrodites, with fast lithium-ion conduction, are promising for applications in rechargeable solid-state lithium-ion batteries. We report a new compositional space of argyrodite superionic conductors, Li6-xPS5-xClBrx [0 {$\leq$} x {$\leq$} 0.8], with a remarkably high ionic conductivity of 24 mS/cm at 25 \textdegree C for Li5.3PS4.3ClBr0.7. In addition, the extremely low lithium migration barrier of 0.155 eV makes Li5.3PS4.3ClBr0.7 highly promising for low-temperature operation. Average and local structure analyses reveal that bromination (x {$>$} 0) leads to (i) retention of the parent Li6PS5Cl structure for a wide range of x in Li6-xPS5-xClBrx (0 {$\leq$} x {$\leq$} 0.7), (ii) co-occupancy of Cl-, Br- , and S2- at 4a/4d sites, and (iii) gradually increased Li+-ion dynamics, eventually yielding a ``liquid-like'' Li-sublattice with a flattened energy landscape when x approaches 0.7. In addition, the diversity of anion species and Li-deficiency in halogen-rich Li6-xPS5-xClBrx induce hypercoordination and coordination entropy for the Li-sublattice, also leading to enhanced Li+-ion transport in Li6-xPS5-xClBrx. This study demonstrates that mixed-anion framework can help stabilize highly conductive structures in a compositional space otherwise unstable with lower anion diversity.},

PBE yields the most-underestimated and presumably least accurate surface energies and work functions. Surface energies within the random phase approximation (RPA) are also reported.

Holes at the lower concentration form small polarons, in which the hole is mainly localized on four oxygen ions surrounding one copper ion. The polaron is a spin one-half ferromagnetic polaron (Cu5O4), in which the moment on the central copper ion is parallel to those on the four neighboring copper ions and the moment on the oxygen ions is opposed to that on the copper ions. This is therefore an Emery\textendash Reiter spin polaron rather than a Zhang\textendash Rice singlet. At the higher hole concentration (x=0.125), many cuprates form stripes. Hybrid density functional theory calculations on linear chains of spin polarons separated by 4a0 show a group of bands localized mainly on the stripe. Spins on neighboring copper ions in the stripe are parallel and so the stripe forms a magnetic antiphase boundary between antiferromagnetically ordered blocks of copper spins. Stripes of this kind, which run in one direction only, may explain recent scanning tunneling microscopy data from Ca2-xNaxCuO2Cl2 by Kohsaka et al. [Science 315, 1380 (2007)]. We also consider an ordered spin polaron phase where magnetic antiphase boundaries intersect at right angles. In this case, sets of four copper ions in squares at stripe intersections have parallel spins. This phase may be the 4\texttimes 4 checkerboard pattern reported by Hanaguri et al.

  abstract = {RECEIVED MAY 18, 1932 PUBLISRED SEPTRMBER 5, 1932 Recent deveropments in the application of the quantum mechanics to problems of molecular structure1 have indicated that the properties of a bond between two atoms often are determined mainly by one single-electron orbital wave function for each atom, and are not strongly affected by the other atoms in the molecule; for when the wave function for a molecule containing single covalent bonds is set up with the use of single-electron orbital wave functions, it is found that each bond function tends to overlap to the maximum extent the other function involved in one bond, and to avoid overlapping all others, so that the resonance integrals other than those characteristic of the bonds are small. The empirical evidence of interatomic distances supports this view; it has been possible to formulate a set of covalent radii for use in purely covalent molecules (in which each atom forms covalent bonds to a number determined by its position in the periodic system) which accounts satisfactorily for observed distances in molecules to which a single Lewis electronic structure can be assigned.2 It has also been found that changing the covalence of an atom, and hence the nature of the bond function, produces a change in the radiusa3 Independence of the bonds in a molecule would require that the total energy of formation of the molecule from separate atoms be expressible as the sum of constant energy terms characteristic of the various bonds. This is found to be nearly true for molecules to which a single Lewis electronic structure can be assigned, the deviations from constancy of bond energy rarely exceeding 2 or 3\{\%\}. Data on the heats of formation and heats of combustion of gaseous molecules may accordingly be used to evaluate the energies of various bonds. This procedure is adopted in the following pages. It is then shown that the energies of bonds, when dis-cussed with the aid of the postulate of the additivity of the energies of nor-mal covalent bonds, throw much light on their nature, in particular on the amount of ionic character possessed by them, and permit the localization of 1 Linus Pauling, THIS JOURNAL, 53, 1367, 3225 (1931); 54, 988 (1932); J.

Ionic conductivity in the title compound is associated with a solid-solid phase transition, which was characterised by low-temperature differential scanning calorimetry, (7)Li and (127)I NMR investigations, impedance measurements and molecular dynamics simulations. The NMR signals of both isotopes are dominated by anisotropic interactions at low temperatures. A significant narrowing of the NMR signal indicates a motional averaging of the anisotropic interactions above 177+/-2 K. The activation energy to ionic conductivity was assessed from both impedance spectroscopy and molecular dynamics simulations. The latter revealed that a series of interstitial sites become accessible to the Li(+) ions, whilst the remaining ions stay at their respective sites in the argyrodite lattice. The interstitial positions each correspond to the centres of tetrahedra of S/I atoms, and differ only in terms of their common corners, edges, or faces with adjacent PS(4) tetrahedra. From connectivity analyses and free-energy rankings, a specific tetrahedron is identified as the key restriction to ionic conductivity, and is clearly differentiated from local mobility, which follows a different mechanism with much lower activation energy. Interpolation of the lattice parameters as derived from X-ray diffraction experiments indicates a homogeneity range for Li(7-x)PS(6-x)I(x) with 0.97 \textbackslash textless or = x \textbackslash textless or = 1.00.

This allows an optimization for the HEA compositions with increased likelihood for sites with weak hydrogen adsorption to suppress the formation of molecular hydrogen and with strong CO adsorption to favor the reduction of CO. As opposed to the construction of specific arrangements of surface atoms, our approach makes the desired surface sites more frequent through an increase in their probability. This leads to the unbiased discovery of several catalyst candidates for which selectivity toward highly reduced carbon compounds is expected and of which some have been verified in the literature.},

Although these devices can be very reliable and compact, the thermoelectric materials themselves are relatively inefficient: to facilitate widespread application, it will be desirable to identify or develop materials that have an intensive thermoelectric materials figure of merit, zT, above 1.5 (ref. 1). Many different concepts have been used in the search for new materials with high thermoelectric efficiency, such as the use of nanostructuring to reduce phonon thermal conductivity2\textendash{} 4, which has led to the investigation of a variety of complex material systems5. In this vein, it is well known6,7 that a high valley degeneracy (typically \#6 for known thermoelectrics) in the electronic bands is conducive to high zT, and this in turn has stimulated attempts to engineer such degeneracy by adopting low-dimensional nanostructures8\textendash 10. Here we demonstrate that it ispossible to direct the convergence ofmany valleys in abulkmaterial by tuning the doping and composition. By this route, we achieve a convergence of at least 12 valleys in doped PbTe12xSex alloys, leading to an extraordinary zT value of 1.8 at about 850 kelvin. Band engineering to converge the valence (or conduction) bands to achieve high valley degeneracy should be a general strategy in the search for and improvement of bulk thermoelectric materials, because it simultaneously leads to a high Seebeck coefficient and high electrical conductivity.},

In fact, the net effect of such a high effective mass is a lower thermoelectric figure of merit, zT, when the carriers are predominantly scattered by phonons according to the deformation potential theory of Bardeen\textendash Shockley. We demonstrate that the beneficial effect of light effective mass contributes to high zT in n-type thermoelectric PbTe, where doping and temperature can be used to tune the effective mass. This clear demonstration of the deformation potential theory to thermoelectrics shows that the guiding principle for band structure engineering should be low effective mass along the transport direction.}

Following a design principle that suggests using d5 5 cations for good p-type conductivity in oxides, the Inverse Design approach is applied to the class of ternary Mn(II) oxides, which are usually considered to be insulating materials. As a result, Cr 2 MnO 4 is identifi ed as an oxide closely following ``selection metrics'' of thermodynamic stability, wide-gap, p-type dopability, and band-conduction mechanism for holes (no hole self-trapping). Lacking an intrinsic hole-producing acceptor defect, Li is further identifi ed as a suitable dopant. Bulk synthesis of Li-doped Cr 2 MnO 4 exhibits at least fi ve orders of magnitude enhancement of the hole conductivity compared to undoped samples. This novel approach of stating functionality fi rst, then theoretically searching for candidates that merits synthesis and characterization, promises to replace the more traditional nonsystematic approach for the discovery of advanced functional materials.},

Here we show that this is possible, using a dimethyl sulfoxide electrolyte and porous gold electrode (95\% capacity retention from cycles 1-100), whereas previously only partial Li2O2 formation/decomposition occurred and with limited cycling. Furthermore, we present data indicating that the kinetics of Li2O2 oxidation on charge is approximately 10-fold faster than on carbon electrodes.},

The resultant SCAN+rVV10 is the only vdW density functional to date that yields excellent interlayer binding energies and spacings, as well as intralayer lattice constants in 28 layered materials. Its versatility for various kinds of bonding is further demonstrated by its good performance for 22 interactions between molecules; the cohesive energies and lattice constants of 50 solids; the adsorption energy and distance of a benzene molecule on coinage-metal surfaces; the binding energy curves for graphene on Cu(111), Ni(111), and Co(0001) surfaces; and the rare-gas solids. We argue that a good semilocal approximation should (as SCAN does) capture the intermediate-range vdW through its exchange term. We have found an effective range of the vdW interaction between 8 and 16 \$\textbackslash backslash\$AA\{\}for systems considered here, suggesting that this interaction is negligibly small at the larger distances where it reaches its asymptotic power-law decay.},

  abstract = {Graphitic carbon is currently considered the state-of-the-art material for the negative electrode in lithium ion cells, mainly due to its high reversibility and low operating potential. However, carbon anodes exhibit mediocre charge/ discharge rate performance, which contributes to severe transport-induced surface structural damage upon prolonged cycling and limits the lifetime of the cell. Lithium bulk diffusion in graphitic carbon is not yet completely understood, partly due to the complexity of measuring bulk transport properties in finite-sized nonisotropic particles. To solve this problem for graphite, we use the Devanathan- Stachurski electrochemical methodology combined with ab initio computations to deconvolute and quantify the mechanism of lithium ion diffusion in highly oriented pyrolytic graphite (HOPG). The results reveal inherent high lithium ion diffusivity in the direction parallel to the graphene plane ({$\sim$}10-7-10-6 cm2 s-1), as compared to sluggish lithiumion transport along grain boundaries ({$\sim$}10-11cm2 s-1), indicating the possibility of rational design of carbonaceous materials and composite electrodes with very high rate capability.},

Both methods require an initial guess for the reaction pathway. A poorly chosen initial guess can cause slow convergence, convergence to an incorrect pathway, or even failed electronic structure force calculations along the guessed pathway. This paper presents a growing string method that can find minimum energy pathways and transition states without the requirement of an initial guess for the pathway. The growing string begins as two string fragments, one associated with the reactants and the other with the products. Each string fragment is grown separately until the fragments converge. Once the two fragments join, the full string moves toward the minimum energy pathway according to the algorithm for the string method. This paper compares the growing string method to the string method and to the nudged elastic band method using the alanine dipeptide rearrangement as an example. In this example, for which the linearly interpolated guess is far from the minimum energy pathway, the growing string method finds the saddle point with significantly fewer electronic structure force calculations than the string method or the nudged elastic band method.},

Despite these advancements, achieving self-healing in permanently cross-linked hydrogels has remained elusive because of the presence of water and irreversible cross-links. Here, we demonstrate that permanently cross-linked hydrogels can be engineered to exhibit self-healing in an aqueous environment. We achieve this feature by arming the hydrogel network with flexible-pendant side chains carrying an optimal balance of hydrophilic and hydrophobic moieties that allows the side chains to mediate hydrogen bonds across the hydrogel interfaces with minimal steric hindrance and hydrophobic collapse. The self-healing reported here is rapid, occurring within seconds of the insertion of a crack into the hydrogel or juxtaposition of two separate hydrogel pieces. The healing is reversible and can be switched on and off via changes in pH, allowing external control over the healing process. Moreover, the hydrogels can sustain multiple cycles of healing and separation without compromising their mechanical properties and healing kinetics.

  abstract = {Architected materials that consist of periodic arrangements of nodes and struts are lightweight and can exhibit combinations of properties (such as negative Poisson ratios) that do not occur in conventional solids. Architected materials reported previously are usually constructed from identical `unit cells' arranged so that they all have the same orientation. As a result, when loaded beyond the yield point, localized bands of high stress emerge, causing catastrophic collapse of the mechanical strength of the material. This `post-yielding collapse' is analogous to the rapid decreases in stress associated with dislocation slip in metallic single crystals. Here we use the hardening mechanisms found in crystalline materials to develop architected materials that are robust and damage-tolerant, by mimicking the microscale structure of crystalline materials\textemdash such as grain boundaries, precipitates and phases. The crystal-inspired mesoscale structures in our architected materials are as important for their mechanical properties as are crystallographic microstructures in metallic alloys. Our approach combines the hardening principles of metallurgy and architected materials, enabling the design of materials with desired properties.},

  abstract = {In this Review, we discuss the state-of-the-art understanding of non-precious transition metal oxides that catalyze the oxygen reduction and evolution reactions. Understanding and mastering the kinetics of oxygen electrocatalysis is instrumental to making use of photosynthesis, advancing solar fuels, fuel cells, electrolyzers, and metal-air batteries. We first present key insights, assumptions and limitations of well-known activity descriptors and reaction mechanisms in the past four decades. The turnover frequency of crystalline oxides as promising catalysts is also put into perspective with amorphous oxides and photosystem II. Particular attention is paid to electronic structure parameters that can potentially govern the adsorbate binding strength and thus provide simple rationales and design principles to predict new catalyst chemistries with enhanced activity. We share new perspective synthesizing mechanism and electronic descriptors developed from both molecular orbital and solid state band structure principles. We conclude with an outlook on the opportunities in future research within this rapidly developing field. Broader Context The formation of chemical bonds is an energy dense mode of storing energy. In both nature and technology, the electrochemical generation and consumption of fuels is one of the most efficient routes for energy usage. Solar and electrical energy can be stored in chemical bonds by splitting water or metal oxides to produce hydrogen and metal. These compounds can then be oxidized to produce energy when coupled to the reduction of oxygen. However, these device efficiencies are severely limited by the catalysis of oxygen electrochemical processes \textendash{} namely the oxygen reduction reaction and oxygen evolution reaction, which have slow kinetics. Non-precious transition metal oxides show promise as cost-effective substitutes for noble metals in commercially viable renewable energy storage and conversion devices. Furthermore, this class of materials has ben efitted from a wealth of spectroscopic and first-principles studies in the past few decades, providing the frameworks and theories needed to understand the electronic structure and design optimal catalysts. The incredibly diverse range of chemistries and physical properties that can be explored in oxide families afford numerous degrees of freedom for conducting systematic investigations relating intrinsic mat erial properties to catalytic performance. Here, we present background on the fundamental concepts in catalysis for the rational design of transition metal perovskite oxide catalysts for oxygen electrocatalysis and critically examine the current understanding a nd its impact on future directions of perovskite catalysts.},

In this review, we describe the critical role of body size measurements in cardiovascular medicine. Using examples, we illustrate the confounding effects of body size. Current cardiovascular scaling practices are reviewed, as are limitations and alternative relationships between body and cardiovascular dimensions. The experimental evidence, theoretical basis, and clinical application of scaling of various functional parameters are presented. Appropriately scaled parameters aid diagnostic and therapeutic decision making in specific disease states such as hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and congestive heart failure. Large-scale studies in clinical populations are needed to define normative relationships for this purpose. Lack of appropriate consideration of body size in the evaluation of cardiovascular structure and function may adversely affect recognition and treatment of cardiovascular disease states in the adult patient.},

In the present contribution, we show that efficient and accurate prediction of a diverse set of properties of material systems is possible by employing machine (or statistical) learning methods trained on quantum mechanical computations in combination with the notions of chemical similarity. Using a family of one-dimensional chain systems, we present a general formalism that allows us to discover decision rules that establish a mapping between easily accessible attributes of a system and its properties. It is shown that fingerprints based on either chemo-structural (compositional and configurational information) or the electronic charge density distribution can be used to make ultra-fast, yet accurate, property predictions. Harnessing such learning paradigms extends recent efforts to systematically explore and mine vast chemical spaces, and can significantly accelerate the discovery of new application-specific materials.}

Doing so increased the accuracy of our predictions by 2\textendash 3 percentage points over using any one pair. We also included the Mendeleev numbers of the A and B atoms to this set of feature pairs. Doing this and using the capabilities of our machine learning algorithm, the gradient tree boosting classifier, enabled us to generate a new type of structure plot that has the simplicity of one based on using just the Mendeleev numbers, but with the added advantages of having a higher accuracy and providing a measure of likelihood of the predicted structure.},

Analysis of the soft X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) of the Mn L3,2-edges confirmed the evolution from the Mn2+ to the Mn3+ charge state as a two-phase reaction upon delithiation; the corresponding Mn K-edge extended X-ray fine structure measurements clearly revealed a splitting of the Mn-O nearest-neighbor distances with increasing Mn3+ character. In addition, the O K-edge absorption and emission spectra confirmed the corresponding orbital lifting of degeneracy accompanying the distortion of the MnO6 octahedra in the Mn3+ state. Our GGA + U calculations show that the distortion is not a strict Jahn-Teller distortion but is instead a preferential elongation of two of the equatorial Mn-O bonds (edge-sharing with the PO4), which results in a Mn-O-P induction driven hybridization of the unoccupied states (i.e., a pseudo Jahn-Teller distortion). Excellent agreement between the calculated electronic structure and our soft X-ray measurements of the electrochemically delithiated LixMnPO4 nanoparticles verifies the link between the preferential structural distortion and the resultant hybridization of the unoccupied 3d dxz and dx2-y2 orbitals. Our analysis of the corresponding calculated electron and hole polaron supports claims that the elongation of the equatorial bonds (edge-sharing with the PO4) in the Mn3+ charge state (i.e., the pseudo Jahn-Teller distortion) is responsible for increasing the activation energy for polaron migration and the formation energy of the electron (hole) lithium ion (vacancy) complex of the Mn olivine compared to the Fe olivine.},

ABO is well justified when the energy gap between ground and excited electronic states is larger than the energy scale of the nuclear motion. In metals, the gap is zero and phenomena beyond ABO (such as phonon-mediated superconductivity or phonon-induced renormalization of the electronic properties) occur3.

The algorithms are tested on a standard Lennard-Jones benchmark problem for system sizes ranging from 500 to 100,000,000 atoms on several parallel supercomputers\textendash the nCUBE 2, Intel iPSC/860 and Paragon, and Cray T3D. Comparing the results to the fastest reported vectorized Cray Y-MP and C90 algorithm shows that the current generation of parallel machines is competitive with conventional vector supercomputers even for small problems. For large problems, the spatial algorithm achieves parallel efficiencies of 90\% and a 1840-node Intel Paragon performs up to 165 faster than a single Cray C9O processor. Trade-offs between the three algorithms and guidelines for adapting them to more complex molecular dynamics simulations are also discussed.}

Based on thermodynamic calculations, including Al, Fe, Cr, Zn, Ti, Mg, Si and Cu, model alloys exhibiting a maximum variation of the reachable solute super-saturation of elements relevant for precipitation hardening within the compositional limits of AA6061 were produced. The artificial aging behavior of these alloys at 175 \textdegree C was studied by tensile testing for two thermal histories, including very short- and long-term room temperature storage after quenching. Precipitation during artificial aging was investigated by an analysis of yield strength data. As generally expected, precipitation kinetics was found to depend strongly on the solute super-saturation in the case of very short room temperature storage. For artificial aging after long-term room temperature storage the kinetics showed almost no dependence on the chemical composition. This seems to be an exception from simple precipitation kinetics and can be explained based on the complex role of quenched-in vacancies in artificial aging of AA6061.},

The mechanistic connections between material processing, defect chemistry, transport dynamics, and practical performance are of considerable importance, but remain incomplete. Here, inspired by studies of fluids and biophysical systems, we re-examine anomalous diffusion in the iconic two-dimensional fast-ion conductors, the \$\textbackslash beta\$- and \$\textbackslash beta\^\{\textbackslash prime\textbackslash prime\}\$-aluminas. Using large-scale simulations, we reproduce the frequency dependence of alternating-current ionic conductivity data. We show how the distribution of charge-compensating defects, modulated by processing, drives static and dynamic disorder, which lead to persistent sub-diffusive ion transport at macroscopic timescales. We deconvolute the effects of repulsions between mobile ions, the attraction between the mobile ions and charge-compensating defects, and geometric crowding on ionic conductivity. Our quantitative framework based on these model solid electrolytes connects their atomistic defect chemistry to macroscopic performance with minimal assumptions and enables mechanism-driven 'atoms-to-device' optimization of fast-ion conductors.},

Hence, a major focus in battery research is to identify the most proper formulation so as to minimize interface reactions and enhance both cell performances and safety aspects. In order to identify suitable electrolyte formulations for Na-ion chemistry we benchmarked various electrolytes containing diverse solvent mixtures (cyclic, acyclic carbonates, glymes,) and Na-based salts having either F-based or perchlorate anions and measured viscosity, ionic conductivity, and thermal and electrochemical stability. The binary EC:PC solvent mixture has emerged as the best solvent formulation and has been used to test the performance of Na/hard carbon cells with both NaClO4 and NaPF6 as dissolved salts. Hard carbon electrodes having reversible capacities of 200mAh/g with decent rate 15 capability and excellent capacity retention (\textbackslash textgreater 180 cycles) were demonstrated. Moreover, DSC heating curves demonstrated that fully sodiated hard carbon cycled in NaPF6-EC:PC exhibits the highest exothermic onset temperature and nearly the lowest enthalpy of reaction, thus making this electrolyte most attractive for the development of Na-ion batteries.}

From a comparison of the experimental Co 2p x-ray absorption spectroscopy spectrum with the calculated one we assume an intermediate-spin ground state for SrCo03. The intermediate-spin ground state is a highly symmetrical state with highspin Co d ions on each site. Each oxygen then contributes \textemdash hole which is antiferromagnetically coupled to both neighboring Co ions. In this way the itinerant oxygen holes couple the high-spin Co d ions ferromagnetically. With this model of oxygen holes that introduce ferromagnetic correlations we can also explain the spin-glass behavior for slightly doped LaCo03.},

Since, notably, the optimal basis set is systematically improvable, accurate results can be obtained at a strongly reduced computational cost. Moreover, the simplicity of the method allows for a straightforward use of the code; improvement of the optimal basis and thus the overall precision of the simulations is simply controlled by one (for metals) or two (for insulators) input thresholds.

However, recent spectroscopic measurements have been used to infer the structure of water, and the interpretation of optical and x-ray spectra requires accurate theoretical models of excited electronic states, not only of the ground state. To this end, we investigate the electronic properties of water at ambient conditions using ab initio density-functional theory within the generalized gradient approximation (DFT/GGA), focusing on the unoccupied subspace of Kohn-Sham eigenstates. We generate long (250 ps) classical trajectories for large supercells, up to 256 molecules, from which uncorrelated configurations of water molecules are extracted for use in DFT/GGA calculations of the electronic structure. We find that the density of occupied states of this molecular liquid is well described with 32-molecule supercells using a single k point (k=0) to approximate integration over the first Brillouin zone. However, the description of the unoccupied electronic density of states (u-EDOS) is sensitive to finite size effects. Small, 32-molecule supercell calculations, using the Gamma-point approximation, yield a spuriously isolated state above the Fermi level. Nevertheless, the more accurate u-EDOS of large, 256-molecule supercells may be reproduced using smaller supercells and increased k-point sampling. This indicates that the electronic structure of molecular liquids such as water is relatively insensitive to the long-range disorder in the molecular structure. These results have important implications for efficiently increasing the accuracy of spectral calculations for water and other molecular liquids.},

Through the use of state of the art algorithms and a large amount of data extracted from the Harvard Clean Energy Project, it is demonstrated that these methods allow a great reduction in the fraction of the screening library that is actually calculated. Neural networks can reproduce the results of quantum-chemical calculations with a large level of accuracy. The proposed approach allows to carry out large-scale molecular screening projects with less computational time. This, in turn, allows for the exploration of increasingly large and diverse libraries.},

  abstract = {Electro-mechanical degradation is commonly observed in various battery electrode materials, which are often prepared as polycrystalline particles consisting of nanoscale primary grains. The anisotropic volume change during lithium extraction/insertion makes these materials intrinsically vulnerable to grain-boundary (inter-granular) fracture that leads to rapid impedance growth and capacity decay. Here, guided by fracture mechanics analysis, we synthesize microsized single-crystal Ni-rich layered-oxide (NMC) cathode materials via an industrially-applicable molten-salt approach. Using single-crystal LiNi0.6Mn0.2Co0.2O2 as a model material, we show that the cycle performance of the Nirich NMC can be significantly improved by eliminating the internal grain boundaries and inter-granular fracture. The single-crystal LiNi0.6Mn0.2Co0.2O2 cathodes show high specific capacity (183 mAh g-1 at 0.1 C rate, 4.3-2.8 V) and excellent capacity retention (94\% after 300 cycles at 1C/1C cycling). Further, it is confirmed for the first time that the single-crystal LiNi0.6Mn0.2Co0.2O2 particles are stable against intra-granular fracture as well under normal operating conditions but do crack if severely overcharged. Electrochemical-shock resistant single-crystal NMC reveals an alternative path towards developing better battery cathode materials, beyond the traditional one built upon polycrystalline NMC.},

Here, we report on the discovery of the Eu- and Ce-activated K3YSi2O7 phosphors. K3YSi2O7:Eu is effectively excited by 450 nm InGaN blue light-emitting diodes (LEDs) and displays an orange-red emission originated from characteristic transitions of both Eu2+ and Eu3+, while K3YSi2O7:Ce3+ shows green emission upon 394 nm nearultraviolet (NUV) light excitation. Rietveld refinement verifies the successful doping of the activators, and density functional theory (DFT) calculations further support that Eu2+ occupies both K1 and Y2 crystallographic sites, while Ce3+ and Eu3+ only occupy the Y2 site; hence, the broad-band red emission of Eu2+ are attributed to a small DFT band gap (3.69 eV) of K3YSi2O7 host and a selective occupancy of Eu2+ in a highly distorted K1 site and a high crystal field splitting around Y2 sites. The white LEDs device utilizing orange-red-emitting K3YSi2O7:Eu and green-emitting K3YSi2O7:Ce3+ exhibits an excellent CRI of 90.1 at a correlated color temperature of 4523 K. Our work aims at bridging multivalent Eu2+/Eu3+ and Ce3+ site occupancy in the same host to realize photoluminescence tuning and especially exposes new ways to explore new phosphors with multicolor emission pumped by blue and NUV light for white LEDs.},

  abstract = {Lithium superionic conductors (LSCs) are of major importance as solid electrolytes for next-generation all-solid-state lithium-ion batteries. While ab initio molecular dynamics have been extensively applied to study these materials, there are often large discrepancies between predicted and experimentally measured ionic conductivities and activation energies due to the high temperatures and short time scales of such simulations. Here, we present a strategy to bridge this gap using moment tensor potentials (MTPs). We show that MTPs trained on energies and forces computed using the van der Waals optB88 functional yield much more accurate lattice parameters, which in turn leads to accurate prediction of ionic conductivities and activation energies for the Li0\$33La0\$56TiO3, Li3YCl6 and Li7P3S11 LSCs. NPT MD simulations using the optB88 MTPs also reveal that all three LSCs undergo a transition between two quasi-linear Arrhenius regimes at relatively low temperatures. This transition can be traced to an increase in the number and diversity of diffusion pathways, in some cases with a change in the dimensionality of diffusion. This work presents not only an approach to develop high accuracy MTPs, but also outlines the diffusion characteristics for LSCs which is otherwise inaccessible through ab initio computation.},

However, the nature of charge transport in back-gated devices still remains elusive as they show much lower mobility than theoretical calculations and native n-type doping. Here we report a study of transport in few-layer molybdenum disulphide, together with transmission electron microscopy and density functional theory. We provide direct evidence that sulphur vacancies exist in molybdenum disulphide, introducing localized donor states inside the bandgap. Under low carrier densities, the transport exhibits nearest-neighbour hopping at high temperatures and variable-range hopping at low temperatures, which can be well explained under Mott formalism. We suggest that the low-carrier-density transport is dominated by hopping via these localized gap states. Our study reveals the important role of short-range surface defects in tailoring the properties and device applications of molybdenum disulphide.},

  abstract = {The epsilon polymorph of vanadyl phosphate {$\epsilon$}- VOPO4 is a promising cathode material for high-capacity Li ion batteries, owing to its demonstrated ability to reversibly incorporate two lithium ions per redox center. As lithium is inserted into the nanosized particles within the cathode, the electrochemical reaction can be largely affected by the interfacial chemistry at the nanoparticle surface. We performed X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy using both soft (XPS) and hard (HAXPES) X-rays to chemically distinguish and depth-resolve the interfacial phase transitions in {$\epsilon$}-VOPO4 electrodes as a function of electrochemical discharge. Our analysis shows that the second lithium reaction begins before the full incorporation of the first lithium. This results in a pronounced lithium gradient within the nanoparticles, with the {$\epsilon$}-Li2VOPO4 phase only forming near the surface. These results indicate that a disruption of the kinetics are limiting the realized capacity in our hydrothermally synthesized {$\epsilon$}-VOPO4. Moreover, from inspection of the valence band region, we were able to monitor the evolution of {$\epsilon$}-VOPO4 to {$\epsilon$}-Li2VOPO4 at the surface of our nanoparticles. These assignments are confirmed by hybrid density functional theory of the three end phases.},

Using density functional theory (DFT), we show that a low energy of formation, exacerbated in the presence of humidity, explains the propensity of perovskites to decompose back into their precursors. We find, also using DFT, that intercalation of phenylethylammonium between perovskite layers introduces quantitatively appreciable van der Waals interactions; and these drive an increased formation energy and should therefore improve material stability. Here we report the reduced-dimensionality (quasi-2D) perovskite films that exhibit improved stability while retaining the high performance of conventional three-dimensional perovskites. Continuous tuning of the dimensionality, as assessed using photophysical studies, is achieved by the choice of stoichiometry in materials synthesis. We achieved the first certified hysteresis-free solar power conversion in a planar perovskite solar cell, obtaining a 15.3\% certified PCE, and observe greatly improved performance longevity.}

The infrastructure is largely open-source and handles both practical aspects (input file generation, output file parsing, and information management) as well as more complex problems (structure matching, salt complex generation, and failure recovery). Using this infrastructure, we have computed the ionization potential (IP) and electron affinities (EA) of 4830 molecules relevant to battery electrolytes (encompassing almost 55,000 quantum mechanics calculations) at the B3LYP/ 6-31+G{$\fracslash$} level. We describe automated workflows for computing redox potential, dissociation constant, and salt-molecule binding complex structure generation. We present routines for automatic recovery from calculation errors, which brings the failure rate from 9.2\% to 0.8\% for the QChem DFT code. Automated algorithms to check duplication between two arbitrary molecules and structures are described. We present benchmark data on basis sets and functionals on the G2-97 test set; one finding is that a IP/EA calculation method that combines PBE geometry optimization and B3LYP energy evaluation requires less computational cost and yields nearly identical results as compared to a full B3LYP calculation, and could be suitable for the calculation of large molecules. Our data indicates that among the 8 functionals tested, XYGJ-OS and B3LYP are the two best functionals to predict IP/EA with an RMSE of 0.12 and 0.27 eV, respectively. Application of our automated workflow to a large set of quinoxaline derivative molecules shows that functional group effect and substitution position effect can be separated for IP/EA of quinoxaline derivatives, and the most sensitive position is different for IP and EA.},

  abstract = {The mechanisms and efficiency of charge transport in lithium peroxide (Li2O2) are key factors in understanding the performance of non-aqueous Li-air batteries. Towards revealing these mechanisms, here we use first-principles calculations to predict the concentrations and mobilities of charge carriers and intrinsic defects in Li2O2 as a function of cell voltage. Our calculations reveal that changes in the charge state of O2 dimers controls the defect chemistry and conductivity of Li2O2. Negative lithium vacancies (missing Li+) and small hole polarons are identified as the dominant charge carriers. The electronic conductivity associated with polaron hopping (5 \texttimes{} 10-20 S/cm) is comparable to the ionic conductivity arising from the migration of Li-ions (4 \texttimes{} 10-19 S/cm), suggesting that charge transport in Li2O2 occurs through a mixture of ionic and polaronic contributions. These data indicate that the bulk regions of crystalline Li2O2 are insulating, with appreciable charge transport occurring only at moderately high charging potentials that drive partial delithiation. The implications of limited charge transport on discharge and recharge mechanisms are discussed, and a two-stage charging process linking charge transport, discharge product morphology, and overpotentials is described. We conclude that achieving both high discharge capacities and efficient charging will depend upon access to alternative mechanisms that bypass bulk charge transport. More generally, we describe how the presence of a species that can change charge state \textendash{} e.g., O2 dimers in alkaline metal-based peroxides \textendash{} may impact rechargeability in metal-air batteries.}

Prior calculations have suggested that the presence of halfmetallic surface states in Li2O2 may mitigate electrical passivation resulting from the growth of Li2O2, which is a bulk insulator. Here we revisit the electronic structure of bulk Li2O2 and the dominant Li2O2 \{0001\} surface by comparing results obtained with the PBE GGA functional, the HSE06 hybrid functional, and quasiparticle GW methods. Our results suggest that the bulk band gap lies between the value predicted by the G0W0 method, 5.15 eV, and the value predicted by the self-consistent quasiparticle GW (scGW) approximation, 6.37 eV. The PBE, HSE06, and scGW methods agree that the most stable surface, an oxygen-rich \{0001\} termination, is indeed half-metallic. This result supports the notion that the electronic structure of surfaces may play an important role in understanding performance limitations in Li-oxygen batteries.},

  abstract = {The ability to store electrical energy at high densities, high efficiencies, and with low costs is a cross-cutting issue that impacts a wide range of applications. Rechargeable lithium-air batteries are a newer form of energy storage with theoretical energy densities approximately an order of magnitude greater than today's lithium-ion batteries. However, despite this potential, Li-air technology remains at an early stage of development with many performance limitations yet to be addressed, including high overpotentials needed for recharging. We hypothesize that slow decomposition kinetics of the Li2O2 discharge phase contributes to the overpotential and resulting low efficiencies. Although cathode catalysts have been shown to modestly lower charging potentials, little is known about the rate-limiting steps involved in Li2O2 decomposition, or how these mechanisms are altered in the presence of catalysts. Towards the goal of identifying optimal catalysts, we apply state-of-the-art first principles atomistic simulations to elucidate equilibrium crystallite morphologies and defect mobilities in Li2O2. We find that Li2O2 particles form as hexagonal prisms, with 37\% of their surface area consisting of an oxygen-rich \{0001\} phase and 63\% a stoichiometric \{1-100\} phase. The concentrations and diffusivities of all chemically-relevant intrinsic point defects in Li2O2 were evaluated; the dominant defect at atmospheric conditions is the negativelycharged lithium vacancy, with a free energy of formation of 0.47 eV. Assuming Li migration occurs via a vacancy mechanism, the diffusivity of lithium is predicted to be {$\sim$}10-20 m2/s. In contrast, oxygen is found to be essentially immobile. Since the Li diffusion length is considerably less than typical Li2O2 particle sizes observed in discharged cells, we conclude that slow mass transport in Li2O2 contributes to the high overpotentials observed during recharge.},

Our calculations reveal a cri-terion for the stability of orbital orderings in these layered materials: each oxygen atom must participate in two short and one long transition-metal/oxygen bond. The only orderings that satisfy this stability criterion are row orderings, such as the ``zigzag'' ordering. The near degeneracy of such row-orderings in LiNiO2 suggests that boundaries between domains with distinct but symmetrically equivalent Jahn-Teller distortions will ...},

However, particle size distributions formed by solid-state precipitation are generally not well controlled. Here we demonstrate, through the example of core-shell precipitates in Al-Sc-Li alloys, an approach to forming highly monodisperse particle size distributions by simple solid-state reactions. The approach involves the use of a two-step heat treatment, whereby the core formed at high temperature provides a template for growth of the shell at lower temperature. If the core is allowed to grow to a sufficient size, the shell develops in a 'size focusing' regime, where smaller particles grow faster than larger ones. These results suggest strategies for manipulating precipitate size distributions in similar systems through simple variations in thermal treatments.}

Hot-pressed and pyrolytic BN, both containing               h               -BN as a main component, were used as starting materials. The HP/HT products were investigated by x-ray diffraction via Rietveld and line-profile analysis, as well as high-resolution transmission electron microscopy.               c               -BN was the dominant phase in all products, complemented by up to 25 wt\%               w               -BN and some remaining ``compressed               h               -BN.'' In particular samples, partial crystallographic coherence of adjacent crystallites to x-rays was observed, which has been previously found in superhard transition metal nitride-based nanocomposite coatings. In the BN nanocomposites, the partial coherence of nanocrystallites to x-rays was improved by their strong local preferred orientation, which is made possible by the well-known orientation relationships among               h               -BN,               w               -BN, and               c               -BN phases.

Then, based on the local coordination environment, the relation structure-optical properties is constructed by Density Functional Theory computations in conjunction with the ligand field theory analyses (LFDFT) determining the [Xe]4f(2) \textrightarrow{} [Xe]4f(1)5d(1) transitions.

A very important improvement at the AOM level is the consideration of the f-d mixing that brings coupling term of odd-even nature, essential for the realistic description of the asymmetric coordination centres. Furthermore, we introduce now a principle for modelling the emission intensity. The results are in agreement with available experimental findings. The relevance of the modelling has a practical face in the rational design of optimal luminescent materials needed in domestic lightening and also an academic side, revisiting with modern computational tools areas incompletely explored by the standard ligand field theories.},

Data-centric informatics methods are becoming useful to determine material properties that are hard to measure or compute using traditional methods\textendash due to the cost, time or effort involved\textendash but for which reliable data either already exists or can be generated for at least a subset of the critical cases. Predictions are typically interpolative, involving fingerprinting a material numerically first, and then following a mapping (established via a learning algorithm) between the fingerprint and the property of interest. Fingerprints may be of many types and scales, as dictated by the application domain and needs. Predictions may also be extrapolative\textendash extending into new materials spaces\textendash provided prediction uncertainties are properly taken into account. This article attempts to provide an overview of some of the recent successful data-driven "materials informatics" strategies undertaken in the last decade, and identifies some challenges the community is facing and those that should be overcome in the near future.},

  abstract = {An automated method is presented to identify energetically feasible mechanisms of heterogeneous catalytic systems comprising of several thousand reactions and species. Specifically, it combines automated rule-based network generation of complex networks with semi-empirical estimation of thermochemical properties to (a) generate large reaction networks, (b) calculate thermochemistry and activation barriers of each step on-the-fly, and (c) identify energetically feasible pathways and mechanisms to experimentally observed products. This method is applied to analyze the mechanism of glycerol conversion on transition metal catalysts for which a network of 3300 reactions and 500 species was generated. Using (i) group additivity methods for calculating reaction and species energies, (ii) linear free energy relationships for activation barriers, and (iii) linear scaling relationships for comparative assessment of energetics of species on different transition metals, the energetically feasible pathways for forming C\textendash C scission and C\textendash O scission products (syngas and propane diol, respectively) are identified on platinum, palladium, rhodium, and ruthenium catalysts. Our results indicate that (a) C\textendash C scission products are preferred on platinum and palladium, (b) rhodium and ruthenium will have a comparatively higher selectivity for C\textendash O scission products, and (c) glycerol tends to undergo several dehydrogenation steps prior to undergoing C\textendash C scission, which are all consistent with experimental observations and DFT calculations. We propose that this method can be used to screen a large number of pathways in complex catalytic networks and to thereby identify the dominant modes in the system, because it is fast and scalable in handling larger networks, flexible in accommodating different types of semi-empirical correlations, and generic in handling any catalytic chemistry.},

Total binding energies predicted at lower levels of theory are compared with those from the high level G3 calculations, whereas the sequential binding energies are compared with available experimental values. An increase in the quality of the basis set from double-zeta to triple-zeta has a significant effect on the sequential binding energies, irrespective of the geometries used. Within the same group (I or II), the sequential binding energy predictions at the MP2 and B3LYP vary appreciably. We noticed that, for each addition of a water molecule, the change of the M-O distance in metal-water clusters is higher at the B3LYP than at the MP2 level.

AS-LIBs require a Li-fast ion conductor (FIC) as the solid electrolyte. Finding a solid electrolyte with high ionic conductivity and compatibility with other battery components is a key factor in building high performance AS-LIBs. There have been numerous studies, e.g., on lithium rich sulfide glasses as solid electrolytes. However, the limited current density remains a major obstacle in developing competitive batteries based on the known solid electrolytes. Here we prepare argyrodite-type Li6PS5X (X = Cl, Br, I) using mechanical milling followed by annealing. XRD characterization reveals the formation and growth of Li6PS5X crystals in samples under varying annealing conditions. For Li6PS5Cl an ionic conductivity of the order of 10-4 S/cm is reached at room temperature, which is close to the Li mobility in conventional liquid electrolytes (LiPF6 in various carbonates) and well suitable for AS-LIBs.},

This charge equilibration (QEq) approach leads to charges in excellent agreement with experimental dipole moments and with the atomic charges obtained from the electrostatic potentials of accurate ab initio calculations. QEq can be used to predict charges for any polymer, ceramic, semiconductor,or biological system, allowing extension of molecular dynamics studies to broad classes of new systems.

During this enzyme catalysis, the 7,8-dimethyl isoalloxazine (flavin) ring of the enzyme-bound cofactor, flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD), shuttles between reduced and oxidized states as the enzyme passes through multiple cycles of binding/release of alternate substrates. These redox changes in NQO2, however, lead to unequal charge separation between the flavin ring and the active site, which must be stabilized by reorganization of the surrounding protein matrix. In this study, we have used a combined quantum mechanical/molecular mechanical method to simulate the electron and proton addition reactions of the flavin-bound NQO2. We have computed the redox potentials and pK(a)'s of the enzyme-bound flavin. The present work demonstrates that upon reduction, the NQO2 active site stabilizes the flavin anionic hydroquinone state. Simulation data has also allowed quantitative estimation of the electrostatic contributions of active site residues. Their significance in oscillatory redox transition of this flavoenzyme is discussed.},

We probe EC-LiPF6 electrolyte system for a range of concentrations: 0.06 to 4 M using molecular dynamics simulations to study the effect of concentration on transport and structural properties. Molecular structure of the solution changes with concentration from a predominantly solvent separated ion pair (SSIP) configuration at the dilute limit to an aggregate rich configuration at high concentration. Depletion of SSIPs and formation of more aggregates at higher concentrations affect the transport properties.

  abstract = {The one-electron reduction of quinones is important not only in electrochemistry but also in biochemical energy storage, energy utilization, and organic chemcial reactions. Thermodynamic cycles are investigated to estimate aqueous one-electron reduction potentials for the redox indicators p-benzoquinone and p-duroquinone, as well as chloro-substituted p-benzoquinones. Gas-phase reduction free energy differences are approximated from electron affinities calculated by using the hybrid HartreeFock/density-functional B3LYP method, a semiempirical quantum chemical method that expresses a molecule's exchange-correlation energy as a weighted sum of HartreeFock, local, and gradient-corrected density-functional energies. Free energy perturbation theory was used with molecular dynamics simulations (at constant temperature, pressure, and number of atoms) to estimate hydration free energy differences. Calculated one-electron reduction potentials for the quinones are within 10190 meV of experimental values. An exceptionally accurate reduction potential was calculated for p-benzoquinone (E0calc = 4.51 eV and E0expt = 4.52 to 4.54 eV) and least accuracy was obtained for p-duroquinone (E0calc = 3.99 eV and E0expt = 4.184.21 eV). Radial distribution functions show that more hydrogens contact the oxygens of the p-benzosemiquinone anions than the oxygen atoms of the neutral quinones. The strengths and numbers of water hydrogen bonds to the semiquinone anions also correlate with hydration free energy differences between the quinones and their semiquinone anions, implying that models of water solvation designed to reproduce hydration free energy differences or reduction potentials should somehow incorporate the effects of specific solutewater interactions.},

The purpose of the study was to examine how the Marcus curves depend on the applied potential and on the distance of the redox species from an electrode. The pronounced oscillations in the mean electrical potential seen in molten salt systems in the "double-layer" region are not reflected in the reaction free energy for the electron transfer event.

However, current theoretical calculations often use a number of simplified models to account for many-body effects, in lieu of first principles calculations. In an effort to overcome these limitations we describe in this article a number of recent advances in theory and in theoretical codes which offer the prospect of parameter free calculations that include the dominant many-body effects. These advances are based on ab initio calculations of the dielectric and vibrational response of a system. Calculations of the dielectric function over a broad spectrum yield system dependent self-energies and mean-free paths, as well as intrinsic losses due to multi-electron excitations. Calculations of the dynamical matrix yield vibrational damping in terms of multiple-scattering Debye-Waller factors. Our ab initio methods for determining these many-body effects have led to new, improved, and broadly applicable x-ray and electron spectroscopy codes. To cite this article: J.J. Rehr et al., C. R.

The authors focus on extended x-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) well above an x-ray edge, and, to a lesser extent, on x-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) closer to an edge. The discussion includes both formal considerations, derived from a many-electron formulation, and practical computational methods based on independent-electron models, with many-body effects lumped into various inelastic losses and energy shifts. The main conceptual issues in XAFS theory are identified and their relative importance is assessed; these include the convergence of the multiple-scattering expansion, curved-wave effects, the scattering potential, inelastic losses, self-energy shifts, and vibrations and structural disorder. The advantages and limitations of current computational approaches are addressed, with particular regard to quantitative experimental comparisons.},

Detailed resource estimates show that, even when taking into account the substantial overhead of quantum error correction, and the need to compile into discrete gate sets, the necessary computations can be performed in reasonable time on small quantum computers. This demonstrates that quantum computers will realistically be able to tackle important problems in chemistry that are both scientifically and economically significant.},

The order/disorder transition is studied as a function of temperature allowing the determination of an order/disorderphase diagram. In situ x-ray diffraction measurements facilitate a direct observation of the effects of deintercalationon the host lattice crystal structure. The other phase transition is shown to be first order (coexisting phases are observedfor 0.75 x 0.93) involving a significant expansion of the c-lattice parameter of the hexagonal unit cell.

  abstract = {Deep learning has fostered many novel applications in materials informatics. However, the inverse design of inorganic crystals, \$\textbackslash textit\{i.e.\}\$ generating new crystal structure with targeted properties, remains a grand challenge. An important ingredient for such generative models is an invertible representation that accesses the full periodic table. This is challenging due to limited data availability and the complexity of 3D periodic crystal structures. In this paper, we present a generalized invertible representation that encodes the crystallographic information into the descriptors in both real space and reciprocal space. Combining with a generative variational autoencoder (VAE), a wide range of crystallographic structures and chemistries with desired properties can be inverse-designed. We show that our VAE model predicts novel crystal structures that do not exist in the training and test database (Materials Project) with targeted formation energies and band gaps. We validate those predicted crystals by first-principles calculations. Finally, to design solids with practical applications, we address the sparse label problem by building a semi-supervised VAE and demonstrate its successful prediction of unique thermoelectric materials},

Sulfones are known for strong resistance against oxidation, yet their application in LMBs is restricted because of their poor compatibility with Li-metal anodes, high viscosity, and poor wettability. Here, we demonstrate that a high Li CE over 98\% can be achieved in concentrated sulfone-based electrolytes. Furthermore, the viscosity and wettability issues of sulfones are resolved by the addition of a fluorinated ether, 1,1,2,2-tetrafluoroethyl-2,2,3,3-tetrafluoropropyl ether, to form a localized high-concentration electrolyte (LHCE), which not only provides further improvement in Li CE (98.8\%) but also remains anodically stable with high-voltage cathodes, suppresses Al corrosion, and enables LMBs to operate in a wide temperature range. As a result, significantly improved cycling performance of LMBs has been realized with sulfone-based LHCE.},

However, its energy efficiency is greatly undermined by the large overpotentials of the discharge (formation of Li(2)O(2)) and charge (oxidation of Li(2)O(2)) reactions. The parasitic reactions of electrolyte and carbon electrode induced by the high charging potential cause the decay of capacity and limit the battery life. Here, a K-O(2) battery is report that uses K(+) ions to capture O(2)(-) to form the thermodynamically stable KO(2) product. This allows for the battery to operate through the one-electron redox process of O(2)/O(2)(-). Our studies confirm the formation and removal of KO(2) in the battery cycle test. Furthermore, without the use of catalysts, the battery shows a low discharge/charge potential gap of less than 50 mV at a modest current density, which is the lowest one that has ever been reported in metal-oxygen batteries.},

In response to this challenge, we present a combined experimental and computational approach that examines the principles behind dopant-induced crystallographic faceting in nanoparticles. We base our study on nanoparticles of tantalum carbide doped with nickel, iron, cobalt, niobium, and titanium and observe a very significant transition from round/irregular particle shapes to cubes and cuboctahedrons upon the addition of transition metal dopants. The presence of the dopants, which segregate toward the surface of the particles, results in atomic orbital hybridization, causing a significant decrease of up to 0.13 eV{$\cdot$}\AA -2 in the surface energy of the (100) facets, thus providing the driving force for the formation of nanocubes with exposed (100) surfaces. These principles can be generalized to other ceramics and serve as guidance for the optimized control of shape in powders. For example, if one seeks to produce highly faceted V-, Hf-, or Zr-carbide nanoparticles, doping strategies reported here can be applied. Other elements may also be effective in changing the growth habits of crystals based on surface segregation and dopant-host atomic orbital hybridization.},

  abstract = {The entropy of lithiation of LixCoO2 for 0.5,x\o 1.0 was determined from measurements of the temperature dependence of equilibrated voltages of electrochemical cells. Measured changes in the entropy of the lithiation reaction were as large as 9.0 kB/atom, and as large as 4.2 kB/atom within the ``O3'' layered hexagonal structure of LixCoO2. Three contributions to the entropy of lithiation for the O3 phase were assessed by experiment and calculation. The phonon entropy of lithiation was determined from measurements of inelastic neutron scattering. Phonon entropy can account for much of the negative entropy of lithiation, but its changes with lithium concentration were found to be small. Electronic structure calculations in the local density approximation gave a small electronic entropy of lithiation of the O3 phase. The configurational entropy from lithium-vacancy disorder was large enough to account for most of the compositional trend in the entropy of lithiation of the O3 phase if ordered structures exist at lithium concentrations of x=1/2 and x=5/6. The electrochemical measurements showed the existence of a two-phase region in the composition range between x=5/6 and 0.95. Electronic structure calculations gave evidence that these phases were metallic and insulating, respectively. Changes of the electronic and configurational entropy were found to be of comparable importance for this metal-insulator transition.},

Development of solid-state batteries with ionic electrolytes eliminates this concern, while also allowing novel device architectures and potentially improving cycle life. Here we report the computation-assisted discovery and synthesis of a high-performance solid-state electrolyte material: Na 10 SnP 2 S 12 , with room temperature ionic conductivity of 0.4 mS cm \`A rivalling the conductivity of the best sodium sulfide solid electrolytes to date.

On initial deintercalation of lithium, Ni21 is oxidized to Ni41 but further lithium removal is possible. Two mechanisms have been considered to explain the ability to overcharge, simultaneous oxygen loss or H1 exchange the latter are generated from decomposition of the electrolyte.We show that the dominant mechanism of Li overcapacity during electrochemical charging is oxygen loss, in agreement with Dahn's results. Some H1 exchange does occur, however, and this is greater at 55\textdegree C than at 30\textdegree C, accounting for about 25\% of the excess lithium removed at the higher temperature. In contrast to electrochemical charging, chemical removal of lithium using NO2BF4 is accompanied by more H1 exchange than oxygen loss.},

In this work, we suggest an approach employing three classes of Bayesian machine learning (ML) models to correlate electronic absorption spectra of nanoaggregates with the strength of intermolecular electronic couplings in organic conducting and semiconducting materials. As a specific model system, we consider poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) polystyrene sulfonate, a cornerstone material for organic electronic applications, and so analyze the couplings between charged dimers of closely packed PEDOT oligomers that are at the heart of the material's unrivaled conductivity. We demonstrate that ML algorithms can identify correlations between the coupling strengths and the electronic absorption spectra. We also show that ML models can be trained to be transferable across a broad range of spectral resolutions and that the electronic couplings can be predicted from the simulated spectra with an 88\% accuracy when ML models are used as classifiers. Although the ML models employed in this study were trained on data generated by a multiscale computational workflow, they were able to leverage experimental data.},

  abstract = {Ptychography is a nonholographic solution of the phase problem. It is a method for calculating the phase relationships among different parts of a scattered wave disturbance in a situation where only the magnitude (intensity or flux) of the wave can be physically measured. Its usefulness lies in its ability (like holography) to obtain images without the use of lenses, and hence to lead to resolution improvements and access to properties of the scattering medium that cannot be easily obtained from conventional imaging methods. The chapter discusses ptychography in the context of other phase-retrieval methods in both historical and conceptual terms. In an original and oblique approach to the phase problem, it was Hoppe who proposed the first version of the particular solution to the phase problem. The word ``ptychography'' was introduced to suggest a solution to the phase problem using the convolution theorem, or rather the ``folding'' of diffraction orders into one another via the convolution of the Fourier transform of a localized aperture or illumination function in the object plane. Apart from computers, the two most important experimental issues that affect ptychography, relate to the degree of coherence in the illuminating beam and the detector efficiency and dynamic range.},

The density x of the sodium in the intercalation layers can be altered electrochemically, directly changing the number of conduction electrons on the triangular Co layers. Recent electron diffraction measurements reveal a kaleidoscope of Na+ ion patterns as a function of concentration. Here we use single-crystal neutron diffraction supported by numerical simulations to determine the long-range three-dimensional superstructures of these ions. We show that the sodium ordering and its associated distortion field are governed by pure electrostatics, and that the organizational principle is the stabilization of charge droplets that order long range at some simple fractional fillings. Our results provide a good starting point to understand the electronic properties in terms of a Hubbard hamiltonian that takes into account the electrostatic potential from the Na superstructures. The resulting depth of potential wells in the Co layer is greater than the single-particle hopping kinetic energy and as a consequence, holes preferentially occupy the lowest potential regions. Thus we conclude that the Na+ ion patterning has a decisive role in the transport and magnetic properties.},

  abstract = {The Nudged Elastic Band (NEB) is an established method for finding minimum-energy paths and energy barriers of ion migration in materials, but has been hampered in its general application by its significant computational expense when coupled with density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Typically, an NEB calculation is initialized from a linear interpolation of successive intermediate structures (also known as images) between known initial and final states. However, the linear interpolation introduces two problems: (1) slow convergence of the calculation, particularly in cases where the final path exhibits notable curvature; (2) divergence of the NEB calculations if any intermediate image comes too close to a non-diffusing species, causing instabilities in the ensuing calculation. In this work, we propose a new scheme to accelerate NEB calculations through an improved path initialization and associated energy estimation workflow. We demonstrate that for cation migration in an ionic framework, initializing the diffusion path as the minimum energy path through a static potential built upon the DFT charge density reproduces the true NEB path within a 0.2 \textbackslash AA deviation and yields up to a 25\% improvement in typical NEB runtimes. Furthermore, we find that the locally relaxed energy barrier derived from this initialization yields a good approximation of the NEB barrier, with errors within 20 meV of the true NEB value, while reducing computational expense by up to a factor of 5. Finally, and of critical importance for the automation of migration path calculations in high-throughput studies, we find that the new approach significantly enhances the stability of the calculation by avoiding unphysical image initialization. Our algorithm promises to enable efficient calculations of diffusion pathways, resolving a long-standing obstacle to the computational screening of intercalation compounds for Li-ion and multivalent batteries.},

Here we present a description of atomic systems that generates machine learning representations with a direct path to physical interpretation. As an example, we demonstrate its usefulness as a universal descriptor of grain boundary systems. Grain boundaries in crystalline materials are a quintessential example of a complex, high-dimensional system with broad impact on many physical properties including strength, ductility, corrosion resistance, crack resistance, and conductivity. In addition to modeling such properties, the method also provides insight into the physical " building blocks " that influence them. This opens the way to discover the underlying physics behind behaviors by understanding which building blocks map to particular properties. Once the structures are understood, they can then be optimized for desirable behaviors.},

Furthermore, investigating the single-crystal structures, the DBM participated in the complex as the enolic tautomer. The values of the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) and highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy levels have been obtained from the cyclic voltam-metry (CV) curves and differential cyclic voltammetry (DCV). Meanwhile, the energy transfer model has been built based on the above studies. The results show that the concentration quenching effect can be weakened by adding Na \th{} ions. The LUMO energy levels are \`A2.93 and \`A3.19 eV and the HOMO energy levels are \`A5.22 and \`A5.29 eV, according to the CV and DCV curves, respectively.

Sodium-ion batteries using earth-abundant Fe or Ti based cathodes and anodes would be ideal candidates for such storage systems. Herein, a new phase of Na-rich and all Fe Prussian Blue Analogue, monoclinic Na2Fe2(CN)6.2H2O, is reported as a potential cathode for such grid-storage sodium-ion batteries. This water-insoluble and air-stable cathode can deliver 85 mAh g-1 at an average discharge voltage of 3 V vs Na/Na+ with excellent cycle life (3,000 cycles). Many facets about its sodium storage characteristics are discussed with particular emphasis on the role of interstitial water on the sodium storage performance and its conversion to the dehydrated rhombohedral phase. Its compatibility with a newly developed non-flammable glyme-based liquid electrolyte, 1M NaBF4 in tetraglyme, is also disclosed along with general electrochemical and thermal characterization of this electrolyte for sodium-ion battery application. Finally, three different types of full cells are revealed with either monoclinic or rhombohedral phase as cathode and graphite or the recently reported Na2Ti3O7 {$\leftrightharpoons$} Na3-xTi3O7 pathway of Na2Ti3O7 as anode. Full cell energy densities of 70\textendash 90 Wh kg-1 (using cumulative cathode and anode weights) could be obtained without any pre-cycling steps. This new cathode and safe electrolyte may hold great promise toward development of inexpensive, non-flammable and highly stable grid-storage sodium-ion batteries.},

We present a hierarchy of density-functional-type theories that describe the interaction of charged particles with photons and introduce the appropriate Kohn-Sham schemes. We show how the evolution of a system described by quantum electrodynamics in Coulomb gauge is uniquely determined by its initial state and two reduced quantities. These two fundamental observables, the polarization of the Dirac field and the vector potential of the photon field, can be calculated by solving two coupled, nonlinear evolution equations without the need to explicitly determine the (numerically infeasible) many-body wave function of the coupled quantum system. To find reliable approximations to the implicit functionals, we present the appropriate Kohn-Sham construction. In the nonrelativistic limit, this density-functional-type theory of quantum electrodynamics reduces to the density-functional reformulation of the Pauli-Fierz Hamiltonian, which is based on the current density of the electrons and the vector potential of the photon field. By making further approximations, e.g., restricting the allowed modes of the photon field, we derive further density-functional-type theories of coupled matter-photon systems for the corresponding approximate Hamiltonians. In the limit of only two sites and one mode we deduce the appropriate effective theory for the two-site Hubbard model coupled to one photonic mode. This model system is used to illustrate the basic ideas of a density-functional reformulation in great detail and we present the exact Kohn-Sham potentials for our coupled matter-photon model system.},

The theory is exact in principle for these quantities, and in practice the required approximations can be usefully accurate. Here, with few equations and without any claim of optimal selection, we present 12 problems in density functional theory that remain to be solved, with an emphasis on formal problems and on the construction of approximate density functionals.

We show how this powerful technique helps people address the highly complicated problems and accelerate the progress of the catalysis community.

  abstract = {Abstract To design efficient materials for organic photovoltaics (OPVs), it is essential to identify the largest number of parameters that control their properties and build a model using these parameters (known as descriptors) for the prediction of the power conversion efficiency (PCE). By constructing a dataset for 280 small molecule OPV systems, it is found that for all high-performing devices, frontier molecular orbitals of donor molecules are nearly degenerated and in such cases, orbitals other than just highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) are involved in exciton formation, exciton dissociation, and hole transport processes influencing the macroscopic properties of OPVs. Machine learning approaches, including random forest, gradient boosting, deep neural network are used to build models for the prediction of PCE using 13 important microscopic properties of organic materials as descriptors. Quite impressive performance of the gradient boosting model (Pearson's coefficient = 0.79) indicates that it can certainly be applied to high-throughput virtual screening of promising new donor molecules for high-efficiency OPVs.},

Here we present a rapid crystal growth process to obtain MAPbX3 single crystals, an order of magnitude faster than previous reports. The process is based on our observation of the substantial decrease of MAPbX3 solubility, in certain solvents, at elevated temperatures. The crystals can be both size- and shape-controlled by manipulating the different crystallization parameters. Despite the rapidity of the method, the grown crystals exhibit transport properties and trap densities comparable to the highest quality MAPbX3 reported to date. The phenomenon of inverse or retrograde solubility and its correlated inverse temperature crystallization strategy present a major step forward for advancing the field on perovskite crystallization.}

We have determined the geometric and electronic structure of the reaction intermediates. Methanol and formaldehyde are only relatively weakly bound to copper, whereas methoxy is strongly chemisorbed. Still, we have identified a highly deformed formaldehyde species strongly interacting with Cu(100) and Cu(110). The reaction paths have been determined by the nudged elastic band method. It turns out that the rate-limiting step is the dehydrogenation of methoxy to formaldehyde, which is hindered by a significant activation barrier. Although dosing with oxygen does not reduce this barrier, it still facilitates this reaction by stabilizing the methoxy intermediate on the Cu surface and causing the removal of surface hydrogen via water desorption. The strain of the copper substrate leads to enhanced total binding energies of all reaction intermediates, but there is no clear trend, as far as the height of reaction barriers as a function of the strain is concerned. \textcopyright{} 2005 Elsevier Inc.

The ionic conductivities of solid electrolytes are currently attracting great attention. In addition to the conductivity, the mechanical properties of solid electrolytes are important for improving the energy density and cycle performance. However, the mechanical properties of sulfide electrolytes have not been clarified in detail. Here, we demonstrate the unique mechanical properties of sulfide electrolytes. Sulfide electrolytes show room temperature pressure sintering. Ionic materials with low bond energies and a highly covalent character, which is promising for achieving a high ionic conductivity, tend to be suitable for room-temperature processing. The Young's moduli of sulfide electrolytes were measured to be about 20 GPa, which is an intermediate value between those of typical oxides and organic polymers.},

The relationship between the conductivity and viscosity passes from that expected for independently diffusing ions in the dilute mixtures to strongly decoupled Li+ migration through a viscous network at higher concentrations. The transition between these r\'egimes is linked to the changing local and intermediate-scale structure in the melts. The decoupling phenomenon is associated with the appearance of migration channels in the network which leads to cooperative effects in the Li+ migration.},

Three relaxation processes, corresponding to lithium ion migration in the bulk and grain boundaries of the ceramics and electrode polarization, were observed in the impedance spectra. Temperature dependences of the bulk ionic conductivity of all the investigated ceramics show non-Arrhenius behaviour. The experimental data have also been analyzed by using the dielectric spectra and applying Cole\textendash Cole function for data fitting. Several relaxations of Li+ ions in the bulk of LLTO ceramics have been found.},

  abstract = {Many scientific applications today are being structured as scientific workflows. Scientific workflows describe the relationship of their individual computational components and their input and output data in a declarative way. But as these application workflows grow in size and complexity, they also use increasingly numerous and diverse resources to accomplish their tasks. Workflow performance bottlenecks and failures become an increasingly important factor in the overall run time (makespan)of the application and, thus, the progress of the science. This paper presents results based on machine learning algorithms applied to workflow features for a diverse set of real application logs. The results show that the techniques can predict potential failures of workflows, during their lifetime, with high accuracy. We also show that the algorithms, and supporting infrastructure,perform well enough that they can be used for online analysis. Thus, this work is a first step towards increasing workflow efficiency and reducing run time through performance-driven adaptation.}

  abstract = {NASICON is one of the most promising sodium solid electrolytes that can enable the assembly of cheaper and safer sodium all-solid-state batteries. In this study, we perform a combined experimental and computational investigation into the effects of aliovalent doping in NASICON on both bulk and grain boundary (secondary phase) ionic conductivity. Our results show that the dopants with low solid solubility limits in NASICON lead to the formation of a conducting (less insulating) secondary phase, thereby improving the grain boundary conductivity measured by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (including grain-boundary, secondary-phase, and other microstructural contributions) that is otherwise hin-dered by the poorly-conducting secondary phases in undoped NASICON. This is accompanied by a change in the Si/ P ratio in the primary NASICON bulk phase, thereby transforming monoclinic NASICON to rhombohedral NASICON. Consequently, we have synthesized NASICON chemistries with significantly improved and optimized total ionic con-ductivity of 2.7 mS/cm. More importantly, this study has achieved an understanding of the underlying mechanisms of improved conductivities via doping (differing from the common wisdom) and further suggests a new general direction to improve the ionic conductivity of solid electrolytes via simultaneously optimizing the primary bulk phase and the mi-crostructure (including grain boundary segregation and secondary phases).},

The formalism is used to characterize the reduced density matrices (or cluster probability densities) and the free energy functional obtained in the Cluster Variation Method approximation. For the particular representation chosen, the expectation values of the base functions are the commonly used multisite correlation functions. The latter form an independent set of variational parameters for the free energy which, in general, facilitates the minimization procedure.

Among them, spinel LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4 material is one of the promising and attractive cathode materials for next generation lithium-ion batteries because of its high voltage (4.7 V), acceptable stability, and good cycling performance. Research advances in high voltage spinel LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4 are reviewed in this paper. Developments in synthesis, structural characterization, effect of doping, and effect of coating are presented. In addition to conventional synthesis methods, several alternative synthesis methods are also summarized.

Currently a viable cathode material does not exist for practical non-aqueous sodium ion battery applications. Here we disclose a high performance, durable electrode material based on the 3D NASICON framework. Porous Na 3 V 2 (PO 4 ) 3 /C was synthesized using a novel solution-based approach. This material, as a cathode, is capable of delivering an energy storage capacity of {$\sim$} 400 mWh/g vs. sodium metal. Furthermore, at high current rates (10, 20 and 40 C), it displayed remarkable capacity retention. Equally impressive is the long term cycle life. Nearly 50\% of the initial capacity was retained after 30,000 charge/discharge cycles at 40 C (4.7 A/g). Notably, coulombic effi ciency was 99.68\% (average) over the course of cycling. To the best of our knowledge, the combination of high energy density, high power density and ultra long cycle life demonstrated here has never been reported before for sodium ion batteries. We believe our fi ndings will have profound implications for developing large-scale energy storage systems for renewable energy sources.},

Both 4- and 5-cationic systems, (Co,Mg,Ni,Zn)O and (Co,Cu,Mg,Ni,Zn)O, can be stabilised into a single rocksalt structure directly only using NSP, while in FSP and RCP, stabilisation can be achieved after thermal treatment. This result indicates, that in 5-cationic NSP system configurational entropy is high enough to directly stabilise single rocksalt phase at lower temperature, while higher synthesis temperature is required to compensate the lower configurational entropy in 4-cationic system. Retention of single-phase at room temperature indicates sluggish diffusion kinetics, making entropy stabilised phases quenchable.},

Ionic conductivity in solid electrolytes can be improved by dissolving appropriate impurities into the structure or by introducing interfaces that cause the redistribution of ions in the space-charge regions. Heterojunctions in two-phase systems should be particularly efficient at improving ionic conduction, and a qualitatively different conductivity behaviour is expected when interface spacing is comparable to or smaller than the width of the space-charge regions in comparatively large crystals. Here we report the preparation, by molecular-beam epitaxy, of defined heterolayered films composed of CaF2 and BaF2 that exhibit ionic conductivity (parallel to the interfaces) increasing proportionally with interface density\textendash for interfacial spacing greater than 50 nanometres. The results are in excellent agreement with semi-infinite space-charge calculations, assuming a redistribution of fluoride ions at the interfaces. If the spacing is reduced further, the boundary zones overlap and the predicted mesoscopic size effect is observed. At this point, the single layers lose their individuality and an artificial ionically conducting material with anomalous transport properties is generated. Our results should lead to fundamental insight into ionic contact processes and to tailored ionic conductors of potential relevance for medium-temperature applications.},

Insertion/deinsertion of sodium into the well-crystallized particles leads to capacities as high as 140 mA.h/g. A potentiostatic intermittent titration technic, together with in situ X-ray diffraction measurements, enabled us to evidence the presence of six biphasic transitions within a potential range of 2-3.8 V (vs Na+/Na). The insertion process within the NaxMnO2 system is fully reversible over the 0.25 \textbackslash textless x \textbackslash textless 0.65 composition range and presents some degree of irreversibility as values of x below 0.25 are reached. Furthermore, we similarly showed that HCl treatment has a detrimental effect on these electrochemical properties because of structural and textural evolutions.},

  abstract = {The temperature and frequency dependence of conductivity, dielectric properties, infrared absorption, and electron-paramagnetic-resonance data are presented for semiconducting phosphate glasses based on oxides of Ti, V, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Mo, and W. The vanadate system is examined in a range of compositions, most of the others in the composition 50 mol\% oxide. A polaronic model is shown to be generally applicable, and the variation of activation energy for conduction with type of glass and transition-metal-ion (TMI) spacing is found to dominate the magnitude of the conductivity. In particular, a strong preexponential factor containing a term of the form e-2{$\alpha$}a arising from electron tunneling is not observed. The results suggest that the theory of small polaron hopping in the adiabatic approximation may be most appropriate for phosphate glasses. Measurements of the static dielectric constant show no effects of disorder at high temperatures. Characteristic differences are noted between the infrared spectra of glasses such as V, Mo, W, and Ti and Ni, Co, Cu, and Mn, respectively, which are attributed to different structures within the glass matrix. These differences are suggested to lead to larger phonon dispersion in the latter glasses. It is found that the dependence of the properties of vanadate glasses upon composition can be described only if effects of polaron interactions are considered leading to a hopping probability of the form c(1-c)n+1, where c is the proportion of TMIs in a reduced state and n is the number of sites surrounding the polaron at which strong interactions occur. Reasonable agreement with experiment is obtained on this basis for the change in electrical properties with the value of c.},

These include: (i) the introduction of an efficient algorithm to calculate the computationally expensive Slater matrices. This novel scheme is based on the use of the highly localized character of atomic Gaussian basis functions (not the molecular orbitals as usually done), (ii) the possibility of keeping the memory footprint minimal, (iii) the important enhancement of single-core performance when efficient optimization tools are used, and (iv) the definition of a universal, dynamic, fault-tolerant, and load-balanced framework adapted to all kinds of computational platforms (massively parallel machines, clusters, or distributed grids). These strategies have been implemented in the QMC{$\frac{1}{4}$}Chem code developed at Toulouse and illustrated with numerical applications on small peptides of increasing sizes (158, 434, 1056, and 1731 electrons). Using 10\textendash 80 k computing cores of the Curie machine (GENCI-TGCC-CEA, France), QMC{$\frac{1}{4}$}Chem has been shown to be capable of running at the petascale level, thus demonstrating that for this machine a large part of the peak performance can be achieved. Implementation of large-scale QMC simulations for future exascale platforms with a comparable level of efficiency is expected to be feasible.},

The relative sizes of the components of the photovoltaic tensor are explained on an atomic basis. Optical small polaron transfer from Fe2+ Li to Nb5+ Nb conduction band states and the subsequent coherent bandlike electron transport, terminated by the formation of Nb4+ Nb free small polarons within about 10-13 s, characterize the first steps of the BPVE. These free polarons, transported by thermally activated incoherent hopping, are then trapped by deeper defects such as Nb5+ Li and Fe3+ Li impurities. The model allows us to explain the strong increase of the ionization probability of Fe2+ Li and the coherent transport length with photon energy. The low mobility of the Nb4+ Nb conduction polarons appears to be the reason for the high open-circuit photovoltaic fields attainable in LiNbO3.},

Incidentally, these calculations already reveal a large number of systems (around 500) that are thermodynamically stable, but that are not present in crystal structure databases. Moreover, some of these phases have unconventional compositions and define completely new families of perovskites. This data set is then used to train and test a series of machine learning algorithms to predict the energy distance to the convex hull of stability.

For mixtures, the same formalism leads to a very convenient method to obtain so-called total correlation function integrals, also often referred to as Kirkwood-Buff integrals. Using finite size scaling, the properties obtained for small systems can be extrapolated to the macroscopic system limit provided that the system is sufficiently far from the critical point. As derived in our previous work (Chem. Phys. Lett. 2011, 504, 199-201), the finite size scaling is significant and depends on 1/L, where L is the length of the small system in one dimension. By considering a reservoir with an ensemble of embedded small systems, we can use the scaling arising from surface effects to determine properties for macroscopic systems by extrapolation. We demonstrate this method for the WCA and LJ fluids, as well a for a heterogeneous system, i.e., argon adsorbed in silicalite-1 zeolite.},

This biologically inspired approach has created highly connected synthetic neurons and synapses that can be used to model neuroscience theories as well as solve challenging machine learning problems. The promise of the technology is to create a brain-like ability to learn and adapt, but the technical challenges are significant, starting with an accurate neuroscience model of how the brain works, to finding materials and engineering breakthroughs to build devices to support these models, to creating a programming framework so the systems can learn, to creating applications with brain-like capabilities. In this work, we provide a comprehensive survey of the research and motivations for neuromorphic computing over its history. We begin with a 35-year review of the motivations and drivers of neuromorphic computing, then look at the major research areas of the field, which we define as neuro-inspired models, algorithms and learning approaches, hardware and devices, supporting systems, and finally applications. We conclude with a broad discussion on the major research topics that need to be addressed in the coming years to see the promise of neuromorphic computing fulfilled. The goals of this work are to provide an exhaustive review of the research conducted in neuromorphic computing since the inception of the term, and to motivate further work by illuminating gaps in the field where new research is needed.},

The normal state uncomplicated by thermal fluctuations can be studied using applied magnetic fields that are sufficiently strong to suppress long-range superconductivity at low temperatures. Proposals in which the normal ground state is characterized by small Fermi surface pockets that exist in the absence of symmetry breaking have been superseded by models based on the existence of a superlattice that breaks the translational symmetry of the underlying lattice. Recently, a charge superlattice model that positions a small electron-like Fermi pocket in the vicinity of the nodes (where the superconducting gap is minimum) has been proposed as a replacement for the prevalent superlattice models that position the Fermi pocket in the vicinity of the pseudogap at the antinodes (where the superconducting gap is maximum). Although some ingredients of symmetry breaking have been recently revealed by crystallographic studies, their relevance to the electronic structure remains unresolved. Here we report angle-resolved quantum oscillation measurements in the underdoped copper oxide YBa2Cu3O6 + x. These measurements reveal a normal ground state comprising electron-like Fermi surface pockets located in the vicinity of the nodes, and also point to an underlying superlattice structure of low frequency and long wavelength with features in common with the charge order identified recently by complementary spectroscopic techniques.},

  abstract = {In the development of low cost, sustainable, and energy-dense batteries, chloride-based compounds are promising catholyte materials for solid-state batteries owing to their high Na-ion conductivities and oxidative stabilities. The ability to further improve Na-ion conduction, however, requires an understanding of the impact of long-range and local structural features on transport in these systems. In this study, we leverage different synthesis methods to control polymorphism and cation disorder in Na-Y-Zr-Cl solid electrolytes and interrogate the impact on Na-ion conduction. We demonstrate the existence of a more conductive P2\$\_1\$/n polymorph of Na\$\_2\$ZrCl\$\_6\$ formed upon ball milling. In Na\$\_3\$YCl\$\_6\$, the R\$\textbackslash bar\{3\}\$ polymorph is shown to be more conductive than its P2\$\_1\$/n counterpart owing to the presence of intrinsic vacancies and disorder on the Y sublattice. Transition metal ordering in the Na\$\_\{2.25\}\$Y\$\_\{0.25\}\$Zr\$\_\{0.75\}\$Cl\$\_6\$ composition strongly impacts Na-ion transport, where a greater mixing of Y\$\^\{3+\}\$ and Zr\$\^\{4+\}\$ on the transition metal sublattice facilitates ion migration through partial activation of Cl rotations at relevant temperatures. Overall, Na-ion transport sensitively depends on the phases and transition metal distributions stabilized during synthesis. These results are likely generalizable to other halide compositions and indicate that achieving control over the synthetic protocol and resultant structure is key in the pursuit of improved catholytes for high voltage solid-state sodium-ion batteries.},

Phys. Lett., 2013, 102, 241112] and that the splitting of the 4f shell of Ce(3+) in these materials is slightly smaller than 4000 cm(-1) and much larger than the 2000-2500 cm(-1) commonly assumed in analyses of 5d \textrightarrow{} 4f emission bands. Why this wrong assumption has been working well so far is explained by the fact that the intensity of the emission to the seventh level of the 4f(1) configuration is found to be only one hundredth of the integrated intensity of the emissions to the other six levels, which group themselves into two sets of three individual levels separated by 2000-2500 cm(-1). The effective field splitting and the spin-orbit coupling splitting are found to be of the same size. From a strong field coupling point of view, the first six levels result from the interactions between (2)T2u and (2)T1u cubic levels and the higher, isolated seventh level comes directly from the cubic (2)A2u. From a weak field coupling point of view, the first three levels result from the splitting of (2)F5/2, the second three levels from the splitting of (2)F7/2 and the seventh level from a strong, cubic field driven interaction between (2)F7/2 and (2)F5/2 components [Herrmann et al., J.

Recently, frameworks to construct accurate interatomic potentials that combine a systematic set of density functional theory (DFT) calculations with machine learning techniques have been proposed. One of these methods is to use compressed sensing to derive a sparse representation for the interatomic potential. This facilitates the control of the accuracy of interatomic potentials. In this study, we demonstrate the applicability of compressed sensing to deriving the interatomic potential of ten elemental metals, namely, Ag, Al, Au, Ca, Cu, Ga, In, K, Li and Zn. For each elemental metal, the interatomic potential is obtained from DFT calculations using elastic net regression. The interatomic potentials are found to have prediction errors of less than 3.5 meV/atom, 0.03 eV/\$\textbackslash backslash\$AA\$\textbackslash backslash\$ and 0.15 GPa for the energy, force and the stress tensor, respectively, which enable the accurate prediction of physical properties such as lattice constants and the phonon dispersion relationship.},

An approach to developing MLPs employs a systematic set of polynomial invariants including high-order ones to represent the neighboring atomic density. In this study, a formulation of the polynomial invariants is extended to the case of multicomponent systems. The extended formulation is more complex than the formulation for elemental systems. This study also shows its application to Ti-Al binary system. As a result, an MLP with the lowest error and MLPs with high computational cost performance are selected from the many MLPs developed systematically. The predictive powers of the developed MLPs for many properties, such as the formation energy, elastic constants, thermodynamic properties, and mechanical properties, are examined. The MLPs exhibit high predictive power for the properties in a wide variety of ordered structures. The present scheme should be systematically applicable to other multicomponent systems.},

Electron and positron tracks are generated by means of PENELOPE, a mixed procedure developed by Bar\'o et al. [Nucl. Instr. and Meth. B 100 (1995) 31]. The simulation of photon transport follows the conventional, detailed method. Photons are assumed to interact via coherent and incoherent scattering, photoelectric absorption and electron-positron pair production. Photon interactions are simulated through analytical differential cross sections, derived from simple physical models and renormalized to reproduce accurate attenuation coefficients available from the literature. The combined algorithm has been implemented in a FORTRAN 77 computer code that generates electron-photon showers in arbitrary materials for the energy range from {$\sim$}1 GeV down to 1 keV or the binding energy of the L-shell of the heaviest element in the medium, whichever is the largest. The code is capable of following secondary particles that are generated within this energy range. The reliability of the algorithm and computer code is demonstrated by comparing simulation results with experimental data and with results from other Monte Carlo codes.}

As an example, the strategy was applied to analyze thousands of 3- 4-, 5- and 6-component alloys at equiatomic compositions of the alloying elements. Currently available thermodynamic databases were used to assess equilibrium phase diagrams for these alloys. The validity and reliability of the calculated phase diagrams were estimated based on the extent of experimental binary and ternary data used to build the respective thermodynamic databases. Alloys with specific characteristics, such as single-phase solid solution alloys with the use temperature above 1000 \textdegree C, were identified using an automated analysis of the calculated phase diagrams. The density, elastic moduli and costs of these alloys were estimated using the rule of mixtures of pure elements and were used as additional criteria for alloy selection. This approach allowed rapid, albeit preliminary, screening of many thousands of alloys and identification of promising candidate compositions, some of which are reported in this paper, for more time intensive experimental validations and assessments.},

While RHEAs, by original definition, are alloys consisting of five or more principal elements with the concentration of each of these elements between 5 and 35 at.\%, RCCAs can contain three or more principal elements and the element concentration can be greater than 35\%. The 151 reported RHEAs/RCCAs are analyzed based on their composition, processing methods, microstructures, and phases. Mechanical properties, strengthening and deformation mechanisms, oxidation, and corrosion behavior, as well as tribology, of RHEA/RCCAs are summarized. Unique properties of some of these alloys make them promising candidates for high temperature applications beyond Ni-based superalloys and/or conventional refractory alloys. Methods of development and exploration, future directions of research and development, and potential applications of RHEAs are discussed.},

Despite containing many constituents, both alloys had a singlephase body-centered cubic (BCC) structure that remained not only stable after exposure to 1400  C, but also disordered, as confirmed by the absence of superlattice reflections in neutron diffraction data. Compressive flow properties and microstructure development of these alloys were determined from room temperature up to 1600  C. Limited compressive plasticity and quasi-cleavage fracture at room temperature suggest that the ductile-to-brittle transition for these alloys occurs above room temperature. At 600  C and above, both alloys showed extensive compressive plastic strain. The yield stress of both alloys dropped by 30e40\% between room temperature and 600  C, but was relatively insensitive to temperature above 600  C, comparing favorably with conventional superalloys.},

  abstract = {A computational study of the electrochemical properties of three isotopic LiMBO3 compounds (M = Mn, Fe, and Co) as cathode materials is conducted using state-of-the-art first-principles calculations. The calculation of the Li intercalation potentials of LiMBO3 predicts that the theoretical energy density (660\textendash 860 Wh kg-1) can be comparable to or even higher than the corresponding olivine phosphates (595 Wh kg-1 for LiFePO4). In addition, the volume changes during cycling are notably low (less than 2\% for M = Mn, Fe, and Co), which may be advantageous for the long-term cyclability of Li rechargeable batteries. An investigation of the electronic structure suggests that the small polaron is likely to be a main conductor of LixMBO3. A study of Li mobility in LixMBO3 crystal structures indicates that zigzag one-dimensional (1D) Li diffusion tunnels are present with reasonably low activation barriers for Li motion. However, relatively low antisite energy for Li-M site exchange is observed, indicating that the metal ions in the Li site can block the 1D Li diffusion path. This implies that the synthesis condition and nanosizing of the material can be critical for this class of electrode material to achieve high-power capability.},

  abstract = {Lithium ion batteries are nowadays key devices for energy storage, and a great research effort is under way to develop and apply new materials. Recently, new approaches have been proposed that rely on the reversible formation of either Li2O or Li2O2 at the electrodes. The details of their formation and dissolution are, however, still unclear. As a first step towards the understanding of these processes, bulk lithium oxides, their surfaces and their nanoparticles have been here investigated by density functional theory and ab initio thermodynamics. At a pressure of 1 atmosphere of oxygen, Li2O2 is the stable bulk phase below 5 K, where a transition to Li2O takes place. Wulff's construction predicts an octahedral shape for Li2O nanoparticles and the form of a hexagonal prism for Li2O2. By taking into account the effect of the surfaces, a size-dependent phase diagram is calculated. At an oxygen pressure of 1 atmosphere and a temperature of 300 K, Li2O is the stable phase for particles with a diameter larger than approximately 2.5 nm. This size-dependent oxidation behavior of lithium should be taken into account in the design of nanostructured oxygen cathodes.},

Here we calculate that the surface layer is Ni depleted (100\% Pt) while the second layer is Ni enriched (50\% Pt) as shown by experiment. Even though the top layer is pure Pt, we find that the sublayer Ni imposes strong preferences in binding sites for most intermediates, which in turn strongly influences the reaction barriers. This strong preference leads to a strong site dependence of the barriers. Considering water as the solvent, we predict that, at low coverage of Oad and OHad, the barrier for the rate-determining step is 0.81 eV, whereas, at high coverage, this barrier decreases to 0.43 eV. It can be compared to a barrier of 0.50 eV for pure Pt, explaining the improved ORR rate for the Pt3Ni alloy. We report the results both for gas phase and for aqueous phase environments.},

Revisions are based on new structural data, empirical bond strength-bond length relationships, and plots of (1) radii vs volume, (2) radii vs coordination number, and (3) radii vs oxidation state. Factors which affect radii additivity are polyhedral distortion, partial occupancy of cation sites, covalence, and metallic character. Mean NbS+-O and Mo6+-O octahedral distances are linearly dependent on distortion. A decrease in cation occupancy increases mean Li+-O, Na+-O, and Ag+-O distances in a predictable manner. Covalence strongly shortens Fe2+-X, Co2+-X, Ni2+-X, Mn2+-X, Cu+-X, Ag+-X, and M-H-bonds as the electronegativity of X or M decreases.

  abstract = {To use density functional theory (DFT) to seek improved catalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in a proton exchange membrane fuel cell, we developed a systematic way to handle the barriers of electron transfer reactions (e.g., H+ + e- + Oad \textrightarrow{} OHad) within the DFT framework. We report applications of this new method to determining the dependence for the barriers of various ORR reaction steps on the operating electrochemical potential for the Pt-catalyzed fuel cell. This method is used to estimate the optimum operating potential. In the Article, we show how to estimate the change in efficiency from changes in the reaction barriers. On the basis of our mechanism and calculated barriers, the optimum operating voltage for the ORR on Pt is found to be 0.68 V/NHE, which is close to the standard operating voltage of {$\sim$}0.8 V/NHE, validating this analysis.},

Control of surface chemistry allows the interfacial resistance to be reduced to 2 \$\O mega\$ cm2, lower than that of liquid electrolytes, without the need for interlayer coatings. A mechanistic understanding of the origins of ultra-low resistance is provided by quantitatively evaluating the linkages between interfacial chemistry, Li wettability, and electrochemical phenomena. A combination of Li contact angle measurements, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), first-principles calculations, and impedance spectroscopy demonstrates that the presence of common LLZO surface contaminants, Li2CO3 and LiOH, result in poor wettability by Li and high interfacial resistance. On the basis of this mechanism, a simple procedure for removing these surface layers is demonstrated, which results in a dramatic increase in Li wetting and the elimination of nearly all interfa...},

The differentiation of the two states, however, could face fundamental challenges if the degree of long-range order in crystals is significantly reduced. Here we report a unique paracrystalline state of diamond that is distinct from either crystalline or amorphous diamond. The paracrystalline diamond reported in this work, consisting of sub-nanometer-sized paracrystals that possess a well-defined crystalline medium-range order up to a few atomic shells, was synthesized in high-pressure high-temperature conditions (e.g., 30 GPa, 1600 K) employing fcc-C60 as a precursor. The structural characteristics of paracrystalline diamond was identified through a combination of X-ray diffraction, high-resolution transmission microscopy, and advanced molecular dynamics simulation. The formation of paracrystalline diamond is a result of densely distributed nucleation sites developed in compressed C60 as well as pronounced second-nearest-neighbor short-range order in amorphous diamond due to strong sp3 bonding. The discovery of paracrystalline diamond adds a new diamond form to the enriched carbon family, which exhibits distinguishing physical properties and can be furthered exploited to develop new materials. Furthermore, this work reveals the missing link in the length-scale between amorphous and crystalline states across the structural landscape, which has profound implications for recognizing complex structures arising from amorphous materials.},

The influence of barrier crossing dynamics on ET kinetics is examined directly via constrained reaction coordinate MD, while the corresponding effect arising from activation and deactivation processes in the reactant and product states is analyzed with the aid of simulation results on solvation dynamics. The departure from the transition state theory (TST) rate constant caused by barrier crossing is found to be moderate and comparable in BMI(+)DCA(-) and acetonitrile despite a huge difference in their viscosity. A theoretical analysis shows that the Grote-Hynes theory yields a reasonable agreement with the MD results on barrier crossing in both solvents, whereas the Kramers theory fails completely in BMI(+)DCA(-). The influence of activation and deactivation dynamics on ET kinetics in BMI(+)DCA(-) varies markedly with reaction free energetics because of the biphasic nature of solvation dynamics, viz., ultrafast subpicosecond relaxation followed by slow subnanosecond decay. This indicates that dynamic factors controlling adiabatic ET in BMI(+)DCA(-) transition from barrier crossing to activation/deactivation as the barrier height for the forward and/or backward reaction decreases. This regime change of ET dynamics is accompanied by the breakdown of TST as the reaction becomes activation-limited in BMI(+)DCA(-). By contrast, activation and deactivation dynamics do not play a major role in acetonitrile.},

Using the free energy perturbation method, diabatic free energy curves relevant to charge separation and recombination processes are studied over a wide range of the reaction coordinate. The diabatic curves are found to vary with the solute charge distribution, especially in EMI+PF6-. Nevertheless, if the free energy of reaction is not that substantial, the Marcus free energy relationship holds reasonably well, provided that the reorganization free energy averaged between the reactant and product states is employed. The effective polarity, measured as solvation-induced stabilization of dipolar solutes, is higher for EMI+PF6- than for acetonitrile, consonant with many solvatochromic measurements. Thus, in the normal regime, activation barriers for charge separation and recombination reactions are, respectively, lower and higher in EMI+PF6- than in acetonitrile. The influence of solvent dynamics on reaction kinetics through modulations of activation, deactivation, and barrier crossing is analyzed. Even though overall solvent relaxation dynamics in EMI+PF6- are considerably slower than those in acetonitrile, the deviation of the rate constant from the transition state theory predictions is found to be small for both solvents. Implications of this finding for other reactions in ionic liquids are briefly discussed.},

Solvent fluctuation dynamics near equilibrium are studied via MD and associated time-dependent friction is analyzed via the generalized Langevin equation. Nonequilibrium solvent relaxation following an instantaneous change in the solute charge distribution and accompanying solvent structure reorganization are also investigated. Both equilibrium and nonequilibrium solvation dynamics are characterized by at least two vastly different time scales\textendash a subpicosecond inertial regime followed by a slow diffusive regime. Solvent regions contributing to the subpicosecond nonequilibrium relaxation are found to vary significantly with initial solvation configurations, especially near the solute. If the solvent density near the solute is sufficiently high at the outset of the relaxation, subpicosecond dynamics are mainly governed by the motions of a few ions close to the solute. By contrast, in the case of a low local density, solvent ions located not only close to but also relatively far from the solute participate in the subpicosecond relaxation. Despite this difference, linear response holds reasonably well in both ionic liquids.},

We also show that we can accurately train machine learning models by integrating high-ranking features obtained from correlation analyses. The demonstrated approach can be extended beyond incorporating thermodynamic features, with input from domain experts used to compile lists of features from other alloy physics, such as diffusion kinetics and microstructure evolution.},

  abstract = {The non-aqueous redox flow battery (RFB) is one of the emerging large-scale energy storage systems that may overcome the low energy density limited by breakdown of water at a high voltage in aqueous RFBs. Yet development of the non-aqueous RFB is at an early stage, so its components are not thoroughly understood. As a key component of non-aqueous RFBs, the role of the membrane is to suppress cross- contamination between the anolyte and catholyte confined in two separate compartments, and to transport the charge carrier ions selectively for the completion of the circuit during cell operation. In this review, recent studies on non-aqueous redox flow systems are summarized including redox couples, electrolytes, and systems including membranes. A focus is placed on comparison of battery performance in terms of the current and power density through membranes. In addition, we introduce syntheses and characterization of membranes used for non-aqueous RFBs. 1.},

The parent compound has a corrugated layered structure consisting of \{Ti6O14\}4- units with hydrated sodium cations and protons in the interlayer spaces. Upon heating to 600C, water is removed irreversibly, the interlayer distances become smaller, and connecting bonds between the octahedral layers 10 form. It was found that this material can reversibly intercalate both lithium and sodium. The initial specific discharge capacities, as measured in half-cells, varied with the state of hydration and the nature of the counter-electrode (Na or Li). The electrochemical potential showed a non-linear sloping dependence with degree of intercalation, indicative of a solid-solution mechanism of intercalation. The process was centered at a low average potential of about 0.3V vs. Na or Li, the lowest ever reported for 15 titanate-based Li hosts. The higher density and potential for higher rate capability of this compound, in comparison to carbonaceous materials with similar voltage and reversible capacities, make a compelling case for its development as an anode material, for both lithium and sodium ion batteries.}

However, the relatively low cycling stability still prevents some of the most promising molecules to be used as lithium-ion electrodes. Herein, we used 1,4,5,8-naphthalenediimide (NDI) as a model molecule to systematically investigate its intrinsic electrochemical property, including its electrolyte compatibility, maximum capacity, cycling stability and rate capability in different organic electrolytes. Extensive physicochemical characterization, electrochemical measurement and density function theory (DFT) calculation together show that the electrode-electrolyte interaction is the key factor determining its specific capacity and cycling stability. With a proper selection of electrolytes, NDI molecule, which was considered to be not stable for lithium storage, can achieve near theoretical capacity (based on 2-electron reaction), very high rate capability and high cycling stability. This study suggests the importance of understanding the fundamental electrode-electrolyte interactions in designing high-performance organic electrodes.},

  abstract = {Measurements of magnetic noise emanating from ferromagnets owing to domain motion were first carried out nearly 100 years ago, and have underpinned much science and technology. Antiferromagnets, which carry no net external magnetic dipole moment, yet have a periodic arrangement of the electron spins extending over macroscopic distances, should also display magnetic noise. However, this must be sampled at spatial wavelengths of the order of several interatomic spacings, rather than the macroscopic scales characteristic of ferromagnets. Here we present a direct measurement of the fluctuations in the nanometre-scale superstructure of spin- and charge-density waves associated with antiferromagnetism in elemental chromium. The technique used is X-ray photon correlation spectroscopy, where coherent X-ray diffraction produces a speckle pattern that serves as a 'fingerprint' of a particular magnetic domain configuration. The temporal evolution of the patterns corresponds to domain walls advancing and retreating over micrometre distances. This work demonstrates a useful measurement tool for antiferromagnetic domain wall engineering, but also reveals a fundamental finding about spin dynamics in the simplest antiferromagnet: although the domain wall motion is thermally activated at temperatures above 100 K, it is not so at lower temperatures, and indeed has a rate that saturates at a finite value-consistent with quantum fluctuations-on cooling below 40 K.},

We consider clean, mostly non-reconstructed surfaces in the slab-supercell approximation. Particular attention is paid to the convergence of these quantities with respect to slab thickness; furthermore, different methodologies for the calculation of work functions and surfaces energies are compared. We find that the use of bulk references for calculations of surface energies and work functions can be detrimental to convergence unless numerical grids are closely matched, especially when surface relaxations are being considered. Our results and comparison show that calculated values often do not quantitatively match experimental values. This may be understandable for the surface relaxations and surface energies, where experimental values can have large error, but even for the work functions, neither local nor semi-local functionals emerge as an accurate choice for every case.},

In particular, we have modeled photoelectron spectra of 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide ([emim][Tf(2)N]) and 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide ([bmim][Tf(2)N]) ionic liquids and their components. We have considered ion pairs in the gas phase and solvated in the water represented by a dielectric continuum. We have also characterized the isolated cation and anion of the ionic liquids. The calculated quantities have been compared with available experiments. The photoelectron spectra were modeled within linearized reflection approximation, using a composite ab initio approach based on combination of the MP2 method for the ground state, the PMP2 method for the first ionized electronic state and the TDDFT method to estimate the higher ionization energies. We have also briefly explored energetics of processes following the vertical electron attachment/detachment. Our calculations were able to reproduce the measured photoelectron spectra. We have shown that the valence photoelectron spectrum results from simultaneous ionization from many molecular orbitals. In the threshold region, the electron is ejected from the anion in the gas phase ion pair while the cationic moiety is ionized when the ion pair is solvated. We have investigated the effect of both short-range and long-range interactions on the ionization characteristics, showing that the long-range polarization of the solvent effectively screens the specific short-range interactions. The large difference between the HOMO-LUMO gap and the electrochemical window has been rationalized in terms of relaxation following the redox processes, i.e. solute and solvent geometric relaxation and reactions, e.g. dimerization of the imidazolium radical formed during the reduction.},

The self-interaction error intrinsic to common exchange-correlation functionals is also corrected by the same penalty functional. The diabatic free-energy surfaces are then constructed from umbrella sampling on large ensembles of configurations. As a paradigmatic case study, the self-exchange reaction between ferrous and ferric ions in water is studied in detail.},

A number of recent investigations, experimental and theoretical, have aimed to gather insight into their unique lattice dynamics and electronic structure. However, the majority of first-principles modeling has been performed at fixed temperatures, and there has been no comprehensive and systematic computational study of the effect of temperature on the material properties. We report a comparative lattice-dynamics study of the temperature dependence of the properties of PbS, PbSe, and PbTe, focusing particularly on those relevant to thermoelectric performance, viz. phonon frequencies, lattice thermal conductivity, and electronic band structure. Calculations are performed within the quasiharmonic approximation, with the inclusion of phonon-phonon interactions frommany-body perturbation theory, which are used to compute phonon lifetimes and predict the lattice thermal conductivity. The results are critically compared against experimental data and other calculations, and add insight to ongoing research on the PbX compounds in relation to the off-centering of Pb at high temperatures, which is shown to be related to phonon softening. The agreement with experiment suggests that this method could serve as a straightforward, powerful, and generally applicable means of investigating the temperature dependence of material properties from first principles.},

Density functional theory calculations were used in combination with the computational standard hydrogen electrode to calculate the free energy profile for the reduction of N(2) admolecules and N adatoms on several close-packed and stepped transition metal surfaces in contact with an acidic electrolyte. Trends in the catalytic activity were calculated for a range of transition metal surfaces and applied potentials under the assumption that the activation energy barrier scales with the free energy difference in each elementary step. The most active surfaces, on top of the volcano diagrams, are Mo, Fe, Rh, and Ru, but hydrogen gas formation will be a competing reaction reducing the faradaic efficiency for ammonia production. Since the early transition metal surfaces such as Sc, Y, Ti, and Zr bind N-adatoms more strongly than H-adatoms, a significant production of ammonia compared with hydrogen gas can be expected on those metal electrodes when a bias of -1 V to -1.5 V vs. SHE is applied. Defect-free surfaces of the early transition metals are catalytically more active than their stepped counterparts.},

These devices, although early in their stage of development, are promising for large-scale grid storage applications due to the abundance and very low cost of sodium-containing precursors used to make the components. The engineering knowledge developed recently for highly successful Li ion batteries can be leveraged to ensure rapid progress in this area, although different electrode materials and electrolytes will be required for dual intercalation systems based on sodium. In particular, new anode materials need to be identifi ed, since the graphite anode, commonly used in lithium systems, does not intercalate sodium to any appreciable extent. A wider array of choices is available for cathodes, including high performance layered transition metal oxides and polyanionic compounds. Recent developments in electrodes are encouraging, but a great deal of research is necessary, particularly in new electrolytes, and the understanding of the SEI fi lms. The engineering modeling calculations of Na-ion battery energy density indicate that 210 Wh kg - 1 in gravimetric energy is possible for Na-ion batteries compared to existing Li-ion technology if a cathode capacity of 200 mAh g - 1 and a 500 mAh g - 1 anode can be discovered with an average cell potential of 3.3 V.},

  abstract = {Light emitting diodes (LEDs) are on the verge of a breakthrough in general lighting, due to their rapidly improving efficiency. Currently, white LEDs with high color rendering are mainly based on wavelength conversion by one or more phosphor materials. This Review first describes how to quantify the quality of a light source, discussing the color rendering index (CRI) and alternative color quality indices. Then, six main criteria are identified and discussed, which should be fulfilled by a phosphor candidate to be considered for actual application in LEDs. These criteria deal with the shape and position of the emission and the excitation spectra, the thermal quenching behavior, the quantum efficiency, the chemical and thermal stability and finally with the occurrence of saturation effects. Based on these criteria, the most common dopant ions (broad-band emitting Eu2+, Ce3+ and Mn2+, line- emitting rare earth ions,...) and host compounds (garnets, sulfides, (oxy)nitrides,...) are evaluated. Although many phosphor materials have been proposed in literature in recent years, the number of phosphors effectively fulfilling all six requirements is relatively small.},

Surface-induced structure that extends about 1 nm from the LiFePO(4) surface was observed in both electrolytes. The electrostatic potential at the LiFePO(4) surface was found to be negative relative to the bulk electrolyte reflecting an excess of negative charge from the electrolyte coordinating surface Li(+). In the ILE system negative surface charge is partially offset by a high density of EMIM(+) cations coordinating surface oxygen. The electrostatic potential exhibits a (positive) maximum about 3 A from the LiFePO(4) surface which, when combined with the reduced ability of the highly structured electrolytes to solvate Li(+) cations, results in a free energy barrier of almost 4 kcal mol(-1) for penetration of the interfacial electrolyte layer by Li(+). The resistance for bringing Li(+) from the bulk electrolyte to the LiFePO(4) surface through this interfacial barrier was found to be small for both the OLE and ILE. However, we find that the ability of EMIM(+) cations to donate positive charge to LiFePO(4)/electrolyte interface may result in a significant decrease in the concentration of Li(+) at the surface and a corresponding increase in impedance to Li(+) intercalation into LiFePO(4), particularly at lower temperatures.},

We also demonstrate stabilized power output under working conditions, and suggest that this is a useful parameter to present, alongside the current voltage scan derived power conversion efficiency. We hypothesize three possible origins of the effect and discuss its implications on device efficiency and future research directions. Understanding and resolving the hysteresis is essential for further progress, and is likely to lead to a further step improvement in performance.}

Herein, we report another, more significant effect of doping in addition to the band gap narrowing, namely, an anomalous decrease in the structural disorder in Li4Ti5O12 upon Cr3+-ion doping. Although it is generally recognized that doping with heterogeneous elements increases the structural disorder, the Cr3+-ion doping in Li4Ti5O12 demonstrated an unexpected structural phenomenon. From the results of various structural analyses using a synchrotron beam, such anomalous structural changes were revealed to originate from charge redistribution at nearby Ti4+ ions. Finally, the capacity was markedly enhanced, especially at high C-rates (125 mA h g 1 for 10C charge/10C discharge, 145 mA h g 1 for 1C charge/50C discharge) because of both the band gap narrowing and the increased ionic diffusivity due to the decreased structural disorder, but was decreased instead for too-high doping levels.}

  abstract = {Following pioneering work, solution-processable Mn 4+ -activated fluoride pigments, such as A 2 BF 6 (A = Na, K, Rb, Cs; A 2 = Ba, Zn; B = Si, Ge, Ti, Zr, Sn), have attracted considerable attention as highly promising red phosphors for warm white light-emitting diodes (W-LEDs). To date, these fluoride pigments have been synthesized via traditional chemical routes with HF solution. However, in addition to the possible dangers of hypertoxic HF, the uncontrolled precipitation of fluorides and the extensive processing steps produce large morphological variations, resulting in a wide variation in the LED performance of the resulting devices, which hampers their prospects for practical applications. Here, we demonstrate a prototype W-LED with K 3 AlF 6 :Mn 4+ as the red light component via an efficient and water-processable cation- exchange green route. The prototype already shows an efficient luminous efficacy (LE) beyond 190 lm/W, along with an excellent color rendering index (Ra = 84) and a lower correlated color temperature (CCT = 3665 K). We find that the Mn 4+ ions at the distorted octahedral sites in K 3 AlF 6 :Mn 4+ can produce a high photoluminescence thermal and color stability, and higher quantum efficiency (QE) (internal QE (IQE) of 88\% and external QE (EQE) of 50.6\%.) that are in turn responsible for the realization of a high LE by the warm W-LEDs. Our findings indicate that the water-processed K 3 AlF 6 may be a highly suitable candidate for fabricating high-performance warm W-LEDs.},

  abstract = {Chemical looping combustion (CLC) is a novel combustion technology that involves cyclic reduction and oxidation of oxygen storage materials to provide oxygen for the combustion of fuels to CO2 and H2O, whilst giving a pure stream of CO2 suitable for sequestration or utilisation. Here, we report a method for preparing of oxygen storage materials from layered double hydroxides (LDHs) precursors and demonstrate their applications in the CLC process. The LDHs precursor enables homogeneous mixing of elements at the molecular level, giving a high degree of dispersion and high-loading of active metal oxide in the support after calcination. Using a Cu\textendash Al LDH precursor as a prototype, we demonstrate that rational design of oxygen storage materials by material chemistry significantly improved the reactivity and stability in the high temperature redox cycles. We discovered that the presence of sodiumcontaining species were effective in inhibiting the formation of copper aluminates (CuAl2O4 or CuAlO2) and stabilising the copper phase in an amorphous support over multiple redox cycles. A representative nanostructured Cu-based oxygen storage material derived from the LDH precursor showed stable gaseous O2 release capacity (5 wt\%), stable oxygen storage capacity (12 wt\%), and stable reaction rates during reversible phase changes between CuO\textendash Cu2O\textendash Cu at high temperatures (800\textendash 1000 C). We anticipate that the strategy can be extended to manufacture a variety of metal oxide composites for applications in novel high temperature looping cycles for clean energy production and CO2 capture.}

With x = 0, long-range ordering of Ni2+ and Mn4+ and elimination of all oxygen vacancies occurs after an anneal at 700 \textdegree C. Above 700 \textdegree C, a reversible transition from spinel to rock-salt is initiated, to accommodate oxygen loss. A sample quenched from 900 \textdegree C into liquid nitrogen traps some rocksalt second phase; the volume fraction of rock-salt phase decreases with oxygen uptake to 600 \textdegree C. However, upon slow cooling (1 \textdegree C min-1) from 900 \textdegree C, the particles have time to eliminate most of the rock-salt phase by 700 \textdegree C; upon further cooling below 700 \textdegree C, the spinel phase and the oxygen gain are retained. However, the spinel phase retains oxygen vacancies and attendant Mn3+ with only short-range order of Ni and Mn. The rock-salt phase lowers sharply the electrochemical capacity of the quenched sample; but retention of Mn3+ in the slow-cooled sample improves the electrochemical performance relative to that of an oxygen-stoichiometric spinel formed by annealing at 700 \textdegree C. The Mn-rich Li[Ni0.45Mn1.55]O4 sample annealed at 700 \textdegree C exhibits a segregation of a long-range-ordered spinel phase and a Ni-deficient spinel phase having a larger fraction near the particle surface. Removal of the Ni4+/Ni2+ redox reactions from the surface stabilizes the electrochemical performance at 55 \textdegree C, but the problem of Mn2+ dissolution resulting from surface disproportionation of Mn3+ to Mn2+ and Mn4+ remains.},

The most important aspects of this approach are the basin-constrained implementation of MD and an automated location of transition states using the nudged elastic band method. We study two Sigma=5 [001] symmetric tilt GB's in Cu, with atomic interactions described by an embedded-atom potential. Our simulations demonstrate that GB's support both vacancies and interstitials, and that vacancies can show interesting effects such as delocalization and instability at certain GB sites. Besides simple vacancy-atom exchanges, vacancies move by "long jumps" involving a concerted motion of two atoms. Interstitials move through concerted displacements of two or more atoms. More complex mechanisms (such as ring processes) involving larger groups of atoms have also been found. The obtained point defect formation energies and entropies, as well as their migration rate constants calculated within harmonic transition state theory, are used as input to KMC simulations of GB diffusion. The simulations show that GB diffusion can be dominated by either vacancy or interstitial-related mechanisms depending on the GB structure. The KMC simulations also reveal interesting effects such as temperature-dependent correlation factors and the trapping effect. Using the same simulation approach we study mechanisms of point defect generation in GB's and show that such mechanisms also involve collective transitions.}

The evolution of the structure of the contacts and the underlying deformation mechanisms are described along with the calculated electronic conductance. Various defects such as intersecting stacking faults, local disorder, and vacancies are created during the deformation. Disordered regions act as weak spots that reduce the strength of the contacts. The disorder tends to anneal out again during the subsequent atomic rearrangements, but vacancies can be permanently present. The transition states and energies for slip mechanisms have been determined using the nudged elastic band method, and we find a size-dependent crossover from a dislocation-mediated slip to a homogeneous slip when the contact diameter becomes less than a few nm. We show that the results measured in a nanocontact experiment depend significantly on the elastic stiffness of the experimental apparatus. For a soft setup, some of the atomic rearrangements might not be detected, whereas others are amplified.}

DFT is less computationally demanding than other computational methods with a similar accuracy, being able to include electron correlation in the calculations at a fraction of time of post-Hartree-Fock methodologies. In this review we provide a brief outline of the density functional theory and of the historic development of the field, focusing later on the several types of density functionals currently available, and finishing with a detailed analysis of the performance of DFT across a wide range of chemical properties and system types, reviewed from the most recent benchmarking studies, which encompass several well-established density functionals together with the most recent efforts in the field. Globally, an overall picture of the level of performance of the plethora of currently available density functionals for each chemical property is drawn, with particular attention being dedicated to the relative performance of the popular B3LYP density functional.},

KnIT combines entity detection with neighbor-text feature analysis and with graph-based diffusion of information to identify potential new properties of entities that are strongly implied by existing relationships. We discuss a successful application of our approach that mines the published literature to identify new protein kinases that phosphorylate the protein tumor suppressor p53. Retrospective analysis demonstrates the accuracy of this approach and ongoing laboratory experiments suggest that kinases identified by our system may indeed phosphorylate p53.

In situ transmission electron microscopy and atomistically informed discrete dislocation dynamics simulations confirm coupled dislocation motion and vanishing obstacle strength for repulsive screw dislocations, compatible with the kink pair mechanism of dislocation motion in the thermally activated (low temperature) regime. We implement this additional contribution to plastic strain in a modified crystal plasticity framework and show that~it can explain the extended work hardening regime observed for [100] oriented tungsten single crystal.

The electrical conductivity of the hybrid electrolytes at room temperature is lower than expected and, more importantly, the relative change of conductivity with pressure is larger than for the liquids. In addition, above the glass transition temperature, the NMR T1 values are smaller and the NMR linewidths are larger for the hybrid electrolytes than for the liquids while at both low and high temperature the NMR linewidths are larger. Consequently, it is concluded that significant solid matrix\textendash lithium ion interactions take place.},

Principal results are presented in the form of statistical summaries of deviations from experiment for the G3/99 test set (223 enthalpies of formation, 86 ionization potentials, 58 electron affinities, 8 proton affinities) and three additional test sets involving 96 bond lengths, 82 harmonic vibrational frequencies, and 10 hydrogen-bonded complexes, all computed using the 6-311++G(3df,3pd) basis. The TPSS functional matches, or exceeds in accuracy all prior nonempirical constructions and, unlike semiempirical functionals, consistently provides a high-quality description of diverse systems and properties. The computational cost of self-consistent MGGA is comparable to that of ordinary GGA, and exact exchange (unavailable in some codes) is not required. A one-parameter global hybrid version of the TPSS functional is introduced and shown to give further improvement for most properties. (C) 2003 American Institute of Physics.},

We validated the concept by directing the automated system to synthesize three pharmaceutical compounds, Nytol, rufinamide, and sildenafil, without any human intervention. Yields and purities of products and intermediates were comparable to or better than those achieved manually.

  abstract = {Despite the great success that theoretical approaches based on density functional theory have in describing properties of solid compounds, accurate predictions of the enthalpies of formation ({$\Delta$}Hf) of insulating and semiconducting solids still remain a challenge. This is mainly due to incomplete error cancellation when computing the total energy differences between the compound total energy and the total energies of its elemental constituents. In this paper we present an approach based on GGA + U calculations, including the spin-orbit coupling, which involves fitted elemental-phase reference energies (FERE) and which significantly improves the error cancellation resulting in accurate values for the compound enthalpies of formation. We use an extensive set of 252 binary compounds with measured {$\Delta$}Hf values (pnictides, chalcogenides, and halides) to obtain FERE energies and show that after the fitting, the 252 enthalpies of formation are reproduced with the mean absolute error MAE=0.054 eV/atom instead of MAE{$\approx$}0.250 eV/atom resulting from pure GGA calculations. When applied to a set of 55 ternary compounds that were not part of the fitting set the FERE method reproduces their enthalpies of formation with MAE=0.048 eV/atom. Furthermore, we find that contributions to the total energy differences coming from the spin-orbit coupling can be, to a good approximation, separated into purely atomic contributions which do not affect {$\Delta$}Hf. The FERE method, hence, represents a simple and general approach, as it is computationally equivalent to the cost of pure GGA calculations and applies to virtually all insulating and semiconducting compounds, for predicting compound {$\Delta$}Hf values with chemical accuracy. We also show that by providing accurate {$\Delta$}Hf the FERE approach can be applied for accurate predictions of the compound thermodynamic stability or for predictions of Li-ion battery voltages.}

Motivated by the early work of Buerger (1951), here we investigate the routes to predict kinetics of polymorphic transformations using solely crystallographic arguments. As part of this investigation we developed a general algorithm to map crystal structures onto each other and construct transformation pathways between them. The developed algorithm reproduces reliably known transformation pathways and reveals the critical role that the dissociation of chemical bonds along the pathway plays in choosing the best (low-energy barrier) mapping. By utilizing our structure-mapping algorithm we were able to quantitatively demonstrate the intuitive expectation that the minimal dissociation of chemical bonds along the pathway, or in ionic systems, the condition of coordination of atoms along the pathway not decreasing below the coordination in the end compounds, represents the requirement for fast transformation kinetics. We also demonstrate the effectiveness of the structure-mapping algorithm in combination with the coordination analysis in studying transformations between polymorphs for which a detailed atomic-level picture is presently elusive.},

The x 0.1 member exhibits conductivity of 1 10-3 S/cm at room temperature with an activation energy of 0.40 eV. The conductivity is comparable to that of commonly used polymer/liquid electrolytes. The ionic conductivity of LLT mainly depends on the size of the A-site ion cation (e.g., La or rare earth, alkali or alkaline earth), lithium and vacancy concentration, and the nature of the B-O bond. For example, replacement of La by other rare earth elements with smaller ionic radii than that of La decreases the lithium ion conductivity, while partial substitution of La by Sr (larger ionic radii than that of La) slightly increases the lithium ion conductivity. The high lithium ion conductivity of LLT is considered to be due to the large concentration of A-site vacancies, and the motion of lithium by a vacancy mechanism through the wide square planar bottleneck between the A sites. It is considered that BO6/TiO6 octahedra tilting facilitate the lithium ion mobility in the perovskite structure. The actual mechanism of lithium ion conduction is not yet clearly understood. In this paper, we review the structural properties, electrical conductivity, and electrochemical characterization of LLT and its related materials.},

Their magnetic properties are determined by the occupancy of the strongly localized 4f electronic shells, while the outer s\textendash d electrons determine the bonding and other electronic properties. Most of the rare-earth atoms are divalent, but generally become trivalent in the metallic state. In some materials, the energy difference between these valence states is small and, by changing some external parameter (such as pressure), a transition from one to the other occurs. But the mechanism underlying this transition and the reason for the differing valence states are not well understood. Here we report first-principles electronic-structure calculations that enable us to determine both the valency and the lattice size as a function of atomic number, and hence understand the valence transitions. We find that there are two types of f electrons: localized core-like f electrons that determine the valency, and delocalized band-like f electrons that are formed through hybridization with the s\textendash d bands and which participate in bonding. The latter are found only in the trivalent systems; if their number exceeds a certain threshold, it becomes energetically favourable for these electrons to localize, causing a transition to a divalent ground state.},

The Li6PS5[Cl0.33Br0.33I0.33], Li6P[S2.5Se2.5][Cl0.33Br0.33I0.33], and Li6.5[Ge0.5P0.5][S2.5Se2.5][Cl0.33Br0.33I0.33] materials were structurally characterized using complementary synchrotron and neutron scattering techniques in combination with 31P magic-angle spinning (MAS) nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. We show that, in contrast to other high-entropy ceramics, an unequal distribution of elements over the respective crystallographic sites occurs in these materials. Using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and 7Li pulsed field gradient (PFG) NMR spectroscopy, we demonstrate that introducing entropy (compositional disorder) marginally affects the room-temperature ionic conductivity ({$\sim$}10-3 S cm-1) but instead lowers the activation energy for conduction to 0.22 eV. Our results emphasize the possibility of increasing entropy in polyanionic materials, thereby opening up compositional space for the search of Li-ion conductors with unprecedented properties.},

  abstract = {Abstract             The antagonism between strength and resistance to hydrogen embrittlement in metallic materials is an intrinsic obstacle to the design of lightweight yet reliable structural components operated in hydrogen-containing environments. Economical and scalable microstructural solutions to this challenge must be found. Here, we introduce a counterintuitive strategy to exploit the typically undesired chemical heterogeneity within the material's microstructure that enables local enhancement of crack resistance and local hydrogen trapping. We use this approach in a manganese-containing high-strength steel and produce a high dispersion of manganese-rich zones within the microstructure. These solute-rich buffer regions allow for local micro-tuning of the phase stability, arresting hydrogen-induced microcracks and thus interrupting the percolation of hydrogen-assisted damage. This results in a superior hydrogen embrittlement resistance (better by a factor of two) without sacrificing the material's strength and ductility. The strategy of exploiting chemical heterogeneities, rather than avoiding them, broadens the horizon for microstructure engineering via advanced thermomechanical processing.},

We further review and discuss subtleties of surface slab creation relevant for performing efficient and accurate calculations of surface properties. We also demonstrate that the nonconvergence of surface energy with respect to slab thickness can be mitigated if the bulk reference energy is calculated from a surface-oriented bulk unit cell, which eliminates Brillouin zone integration errors between the slab and the bulk. Using Pt(111) and Si(111) surfaces as examples, this technique converges the surface energy with respect to slab thickness requiring only one bulk and one relatively thin slab calculation, with moderate k-point densities. This process is about an order of magnitude more efficient than popular surface energy convergence techniques involving multiple slab calculations. ?? 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

  abstract = {Despite the many advantages (e.g., suitable band gap, exceptional optical absorptivity, earth abundance) of pyrite as a photovoltaic material, its low open-circuit voltage (OCV) has remained the biggest challenge preventing its use in practical devices. Two of the most widely accepted reasons for the cause of the low OCV are (i) Fermi level pinning due to intrinsic surface states that appear as gap states, and (ii) the presence of the metastable polymorph, marcasite. In this paper, we investigate these claims, via density-functional theory, by examining the electronic structure, bulk, surface, and interfacial energies of pyrite and marcasite. Regardless of whether the Hubbard U correction is applied, the intrinsic \{100\} surface states are found to be of dz2 character, as expected from ligand field theory. However, they are not gap states but rather located at the conduction-band edge. Thus, ligand field splitting at the symmetry-broken surface cannot be the sole cause of the low OCV.We also investigate epitaxial growth of marcasite on pyrite. Based on the surface, interfacial, and strain energies of pyrite and marcasite, we find from our model that only one layer of epitaxial growth of marcasite is thermodynamically favorable. Within all methods used (LDA, GGA-PBE, GGA-PBE+U, GGA-AM05, GGAAM05+ U, HSE06, and-sol), the marcasite band gap is not less than the pyrite band gap, and is even larger than the experimental marcasite gap. Moreover, gap states are not observed at the pyrite-marcasite interface. We conclude that intrinsic surface states or the presence of marcasite are unlikely to undermine the photovoltaic performance of pyrite.},

Native defects have high formation energies and are predicted to occur in low concentrations within the Fe- and S-rich limits, showing that pyrite should be intrinsically stoichiometric. Under sufficiently oxidizing conditions, OS becomes the most dominant defect type and induces p-type conductivity. At the experimental oxygen impurity concentration, the hole concentration is predicted to be O(1019) cm-3, in agreement with Hall measurements reported in the literature. Therefore, we attribute the unintentional p-type conductivity of pyrite to oxygen impurities and propose that improvements in device performance may be achieved under more reducing conditions.},

Based on the computational results, we propose a dual-interface model to describe the delithiation mechanism of LiFePO4 upon charging. Accordingly, the experimentally observed LiFePO4/stage-II/FePO4 three-phase coexistence could be successfully reproduced. Formation of lithiumstaging configuration is mainly attributed to the Fe center mediated interlayer Li-Li interactions, which is an essential indirect electrostatic force. The indirect interaction originates from the localized nature of Fe 3d electrons, for which the effective oxidation state of Fe redox is determined by the Li ion arrangement and, in turn, has an impact on the behavior of Li ion diffusion. Besides a better understanding of the microscopic lithium diffusion mechanism in LiFePO4, our results also shed light on the interactions between electron and ion and further emphasize the importance of studying the Li diffusion kinetics at phase boundary in phase separation materials.},

DFT is needed especially for large systems, ab initio molecular dynamics, and high-throughput searches for functional materials. DFT's accuracy and computational efficiency are limited by the approximation to its exchange-correlation energy. Currently, the local density approximation (LDA) and generalized gradient approximations (GGAs) dominate materials computation mainly due to their efficiency. We show here that the recently developed non-empirical strongly constrained and appropriately normed (SCAN) meta-GGA improves significantly over LDA and the standard Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof GGA for geometries and energies of diversely-bonded materials (including covalent, metallic, ionic, hydrogen, and van der Waals bonds) at comparable efficiency. Thus SCAN may be useful even for soft matter. Often SCAN matches or improves upon the accuracy of a computationally expensive hybrid functional, at almost-GGA cost. SCAN is therefore expected to have a broad impact on materials science.},

A full lithium-ion battery of 2.3 volts using such an aqueous electrolyte was demonstrated to cycle up to 1000 times, with nearly 100\% coulombic efficiency at both low (0.15 coulomb) and high (4.5 coulombs) discharge and charge rates.},

We have performed simulations of Li+ and electron conductivity in lithium phosphorus oxynitride, one of the most widely used solid electrolytes, using novel hierarchical multiscale models. By comparing the results of one- and three-dimensional models, we show that for this material with complex nonlinear Li+ diffusion pathways, three-dimensional description is essential for reproducing experimentally measured conductivity. We also suggest some basic principles to design optimum electrolyte tailored for low- and high-temperature regimes.},

The chains pack differently depending on which alkali cation is present in the lattice. As a result, the analogs are not isostructural with respect to each other, and each has a different unit cell. The reaction chemistry involving a multitude of reaction conditions and their respective products is discussed. Other products from these reactions include NbSe3 and Nb2Se9 in both crystalline and microfibrous morphologies. The ANb2PSe10 compounds are stable to oxidation in ambient air but decompose when heated above 350 ?C. Their band gaps were measured to be 1.1-1.2 eV and the resistivity of the K analog at room temperature was measured at 4.5 omega?cm.

The room-temperature M6ssbauer spectrum shows two kinds of doublet lines with almost same intensity. The isomer shifts are 0.33 and -0.07mm/s (relative to Fe metal), respectively, the former comes from Fe 3+ state and the latter clearly originates in Fe 4+ state. The trial of further deintercalation of Na ion brings the decomposition of the electrolyte and electrode. Discharge in Li/Na0.sFeO 2 cell is possible, but the Na ions remained hinders smooth lithium intercalation.},

The major emphasis is placed on the analysis of Ni3Al data obtained from published and new results, with a careful consideration of the alloy stoichiometry effect. All data, except for binary stoichiometric Ni3Al prepared by powder extrusion, fit the Hall-Petch relation, whereas the data from boron-doped Ni3Al and mild steels do not follow the Schulson relation. However, no conclusion can be made simply from the curve fitting using either relation. The results are also discussed in terms of L\"uders strain and alloy preparation methods. On the basis of the Hall-Petch analysis, the small slope ky is obtained only for hypostoichiometric Ni3Al with boron, which would be related to a stronger segregation of boron in nickel-rich Ni3Al. In addition, the potency for the solid solution strengthening effect of boron is found to be much higher for stoichiometric Ni3Al than for hypostoichiometric alloys.},

High temperature behaviors for the delithiated states of Li2FeP2O7 and Li2MnP2O7 in the P21/c symmetry are studied. Above 540 \textdegree C, the singly delithiated structure LiFeP2O7 undergoes an irreversible phase transformation to the ground state polymorph with a symmetry of P21. Intermediate delithiated compounds Li2-xFeP2O7 (0 \textbackslash textless x \textbackslash textless 1) convert to a mixture of LiFeP2O7 in the P21 symmetry and Li2FeP2O7 in the P21/c symmetry. No decomposition is observed for both the singly and partially delithiated compounds until 600 \textdegree C showing the high thermal stabilities of the compounds. Analysis of phase stabilities reveals that LiFeP2O7 (P21/c) is intrinsically more stable than FePO4 (olivine) against reduction (high temperature). Similar high thermal stability is also observed for Li1.4MnP2O7. It decomposes to Li2MnP2O7, Mn2P2O7, LiPO3, and O2 at 450 \textdegree C, much higher than the olivine counterpart MnPO4. The high stability of these metal pyrophosphates is rationalized by the stability of the P2O7 4- anion.},

In our scheme, by partitioning the total energy into atomic energies using a local-energy analysis scheme, we can increase the training data set significantly. We use atomic radial distribution functions (RDFs) and additional structural features as atom descriptors to predict atomic energies and GB energies simultaneously using the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO), which is a recent standard regression technique in statistical machine learning. In the test study with fcc-Al [110] symmetric tilt GBs, we could achieve enough predictive accuracy to understand energy changes at and near GBs at a glance, even if we collected training-data from only ten GB systems. The present scheme can emulate time-consuming DFT calculations for large GB systems with negligible computational costs, and thus enable the fast screening of possible alternative GB systems.},

However, fabrication of these devices typically relies on expensive high-temperature and high-vacuum processes, rendering them uneconomical for use in large-area displays1,2. Here, we report high-brightness light-emitting diodes based on solution-processed organometal halide perovskites.We demonstrate electroluminescence in the near-infrared, green and red by tuning the halide compositions in the perovskite. In our infrared device, a thin 15 nm layer of CH3NH3PbI3\textendash xClx perovskite emitter is sandwiched between larger-bandgap titanium dioxide (TiO2) and poly(9,9{${'}$}-dioctylfluorene) (F8) layers, effectively confining electrons and holes in the perovskite layer for radiative recombination. We report an infrared radiance of 13.2 W sr-1 m-2 at a current density of 363 mA cm-2, with highest external and internal quantum efficiencies of 0.76\% and 3.4\%, respectively. In our green light-emitting device with an ITO/PEDOT: PSS/CH3NH3PbBr3/F8/Ca/Ag structure, we achieved a luminance of 364 cd m-2 at a current density of 123 mA cm-2, giving external and internal quantum efficiencies of 0.1\% and 0.4\%, respectively. We show, using photoluminescence studies, that radiative bimolecular recombination is dominant at higher excitation densities. Hence, the quantum efficiencies of the perovskite light-emitting diodes increase at higher current densities. This demonstration of effective perovskite electroluminescence offers scope for developing this unique class of materials into efficient and colour-tunable light emitters for low-cost display, lighting and optical communication applications.},

However, of the various solid-state electrolyte (SSE) classespolymers, sulfides, or oxidesnone alone can deliver the combined properties of ionic conductivity, mechanical, and chemical stability needed to address scalability and commercialization challenges. While promising strategies to overcome these include the use of polymer/oxide or sulfide composites, there is still a lack of fundamental understanding between different SSE-polymer-solvent systems and its selection criteria. Here, we isolate various SSE-polymer-solvent systems and study their molecular level interactions by combining various characterization tools. With these findings, we introduce a suitable Li7P3S11SSE-SEBS polymer-xylene solvent combination that significantly reduces SSE thickness ({$\sim$}50 {$\mu$}m). The SSE-polymer composite displays high room temperature conductivity (0.7 mS cm-1) and good stability with lithium metal by plating and stripping over 2000 h at 1.1 mAh cm-2. This study suggests the importance of understanding fundamental SSE-polymer-solvent interactions and provides a design strategy for scalable production of ASSBs.},

We will demonstrate how thermodynamic approximations based on assumptions of fast alkali diffusion and multispecies equilibrium can be used to effectively screen combinations of Na-ion electrodes, solid electrolytes, and buffer oxides for electrochemical and chemical compatibility. We find that exchange reactions, especially between simple oxides and thiophosphate groups to form PO43\textendash, are the main cause of large driving forces for cathode/solid electrolyte interfacial reactions. A high reactivity with large volume changes is also predicted at the Na anode/solid electrolyte interface, while the Na2Ti3O7 anode is predicted to be much more stable against a broad range of solid electrolytes. We identify several promising binary oxides, Sc2O3, SiO2, TiO2, ZrO2, and HfO2, that are similarly or more chemically compatible with most electrodes and solid electrolytes than the commonly used Al2O3 is. Finally, we show that ab initio molecular dynamics simulations of the NaCoO2/Na3PS4 interface model predict that the formation of SO42\textendash -containing compounds and Na3P is kinetically favored over the formation of PO43\textendash -containing compounds, in contrast to the predictions of the thermodynamic models. This work provides useful insights into materials selection strategies for enabling stable electrode/solid electrolyte interfaces, a critical bottleneck in designing all-solid-state sodium-ion batteries, and outlines several testable predictions for future experimental validation.},

  abstract = {The new emerging rechargeable battery technology, called ''rocking-chair'' or ''Li-ion'', that uses an intercalation compound for both the positive and negative electrodes is safer than the battery technology using pure Li metal. In this paper we review our study of the Li-ion type battery based on the spinel Li1+xMn2O4 positive electrode and the negative carbon electrode. First we give a brief history of rocking-chair batteries, followed by a description of how to select and optimize intercalation materials for such a type of cell and then we present the main findings which allowed us to bring this battery system from concept to realization. Among the main findings are: (1) the use of the second Li intercalation plateau of the spinel as a Li reservoir; (2) the discovery of a new electrolyte composition resistant against oxidation up to 5 V; and (3) the ability to reversibly intercalate 0.9 Li ions into graphite at high rate with a small reversible loss. Based on these findings, AA research prototype cells with enhanced safety characteristics were constructed. We report on the performance of these cells, compare our results with existing or emerging battery technologies such as NiCd or Ni metal hydrides, respectively, and discuss problems inherent to the Li-ion technology.},

The analysis of the discharge curves indicates that the maximum sodium content (xmax) in NaxMo2O4 is strongly correlated with the synthesis temperature of the starting material. Such behavior has been ascribed to oxygen deficiency and explained by means of a simple electronic model. Magnetic measurements of the NaxMo2O4 phases did not reveal structural or electronic lattice instabilities down to 5 K.},

  abstract = {This Perspective highlights, through several snapshot examples, the importance of electrochemically-driven redox reactions in tuning the electronic/ionic as well as magnetic properties of 3d-metal-based inorganic compounds through a careful control of the metal oxidation state. Although such redox reactions usually imply the electron-ionic duality, they can be extended to insulating compounds (LiFePO(4)) or semiconductors (CoO) as long as we can combine electrochemistry at the nanoscale to reduce diffusion and migration limitations, and provide the compounds with electrons through metallic coating techniques. A thorough investigation of the composition-structure-property relationships of the Li(x)CoO(2) system, through the assembly of LiCoO(2)/Li electrochemical cells has led to the identification of the CoO(2) phase, whose property and stability are discussed in terms of cationic-anionic redox competition, thus bearing some similarity with the high T(c) cuprate superconductors. Such a d-sp redox competition could have structural and electronic consequences. Encouraged by the recently reported superconductivity in Na(x)CoO(2);yH(2)O phase, the room temperature Li(x)CuO(2) phase diagram was reinvestigated through Li-driven electrochemical reactions. A solid solution domain was unravelled but superconductivity was not evident. With Cu-based materials such as Cu(2.33)V(4)O(11), we have shown the feasibility of a new reversible Li electrochemically-driven copper extrusion/insertion process, owing to the enhanced copper diffusion within the structure.},

Very strong reactivity at low voltage and vs. Li metal is shown by imped- ance measurements using Au and Li electrodes, as well as 3-electrode cyclic voltammetry.

Although the voltage slowly but strongly relaxes when opening the circuit suggesting propagation of the reaction from the negative electrode to the electrolyte, it does not seem to reach the positive since no short-circuit was observed.},

  abstract = {The density functional theory (DFT) calculations have been performed for the reduction decompositions of solvents widely used in Li-ion secondary battery electrolytes, ethylene carbonate (EC), propylene carbonate (PC), dimethyl carbonates (DMC), ethyl methyl carbonate (EMC), and diethyl carbonate (DEC), including a typical electrolyte additive, vinylene carbonate (VC), at the level of B3LYP/6-311+G(2d,p), both in the gas phase and solution using the polarizable conductor calculation model. In the gas phase, the first electron reduction for the cyclic carbonates and for the linear carbonates is found to be exothermic and endothermic, respectively, while the second electron reduction is endothermic for all the compounds examined. On the contrary, in solution both first and second electron reductions are exothermic for all the compounds. Among the solvents and the additive examined, the likelihood of undergoing the first electron reduction in solution was found in the order of EC \textbackslash textgreater PC \textbackslash textgreater VC \textbackslash textgreater DMC \textbackslash textgreater EMC \textbackslash textgreater DEC with EC being the most likely reduced. VC, on the other hand, is most likely to undergo the second electron reduction among the compounds, in the order of VC \textbackslash textgreater EC \textbackslash textgreater PC. Based on the results, the experimentally demonstrated effectiveness of VC as an excellent electrolyte additive was discussed. The bulk thermodynamic properties of two dilithiurn alkylene glycol dicarbonates, dilithium ethylene glycol dicarbonate (Li-EDC) and dilithiurn 1,2-propylene glycol dicarbonate (Li-PDC), as the major component of solid-electrolyte interface (SET) films were also examined through molecular dynamics (MD) simulations in order to understand the stability of the SEI film. It was found that film produced from a decomposition of EC, modeled by Li-EDC, has a higher density, more cohesive energy, and less solubility to the solvent than the film produced from decomposition of PC, Li-PDC. Further, MD simulations of the interface between the decomposition compound and graphite suggested that Li-EDC has more favorable interactions with the graphite surface than Li-PDC. The difference in the SET film stability and the behavior of Li-ion battery cycling among the solvents were discussed in terms of the molecular structures.},

However, large density-of-state due to flat bands leads to large transport effective mass, which results in a simultaneous decrease of mobility. In fact, the net effect of such a high effective mass is a lower thermoelectric figure of merit, zT, when the carriers are predominantly scattered by phonons according to the deformation potential theory of Bardeen\textendash Shockley. We demonstrate that the beneficial effect of light effective mass contributes to high zT in n-type thermoelectric PbTe, where doping and temperature can be used to tune the effective mass. This clear demonstration of the deformation potential theory to thermoelectrics shows that the guiding principle for band structure engineering should be low effective mass along the transport direction.}

The powder XRD data of Li6ALa2Ta2O12 show that they are isostructural with the parent garnet-like compound Li5La3Ta2O12. The cubic lattice parameter was found to increase with increasing ionic size of the alkaline earth ions (Li6SrLa2Ta2O12: 12.808(2) \textbackslash AA; Li6BaLa2Ta2O12: 12.946(3) \textbackslash AA). AC impedance results show that both the strontium and barium members exhibit mainly a bulk contribution with a rather small grain-boundary contribution. The ionic conductivity increases with increasing ionic radius of the alkaline earth elements. The barium compound, Li6BaLa2Ta2O12, shows the highest ionic conductivity, 4.0\texttimes 10\textendash 5 S cm\textendash 1 at 22 \textdegree C with an activation energy of 0.40 eV, which is comparable to other lithium ion conductors, especially with the presently employed solid electrolyte lithium phosphorus oxynitride (Lipon) for all-solid-state lithium ion batteries. DC electrical measurements using lithium-ion-blocking and reversible electrodes revealed that the electronic conductivity is very small, and a high electrochemical stability (\&\&num;62; 6 V/Li) was exhibited at room temperature. Interestingly, Li6ALa2Ta2O12 was found to be chemically stable with molten metallic lithium.},

The SNAP potential has a very general form and uses machine-learning techniques to reproduce the energies, forces, and stress tensors of a large set of small configurations of atoms, which are obtained using high-accuracy quantum electronic structure (QM) calculations. The local environment of each atom is characterized by a set of bispectrum components of the local neighbor density projected onto a basis of hyperspherical harmonics in four dimensions. The bispectrum components are the same bond-orientational order parameters employed by the GAP potential [1]. The SNAP potential, unlike GAP, assumes a linear relationship between atom energy and bispectrum components. The linear SNAP coefficients are determined using weighted least-squares linear regression against the full QM training set. This allows the SNAP potential to be fit in a robust, automated manner to large QM data sets using many bispectrum components. The calculation of the bispectrum components and the SNAP potential are implemented in the LAMMPS parallel molecular dynamics code. We demonstrate that a previously unnoticed symmetry property can be exploited to reduce the computational cost of the force calculations by more than one order of magnitude. We present results for a SNAP potential for tantalum, showing that it accurately reproduces a range of commonly calculated properties of both the crystalline solid and the liquid phases. In addition, unlike simpler existing potentials, SNAP correctly predicts the energy barrier for screw dislocation migration in BCC tantalum.},

M\"ossbauer effect spectra were compared with differential capacity dQ/dV vs V and it was determined that the sample with the best capacity retention most closely resembled nanostructured Cu6Sn5 grains embedded in a C matrix, yielding over 90\% capacity retention after 30 cycles. However, changes in dQ/dV vs V suggested that regions of Cu6Sn5 were steadily growing or aggregating as Li was cycled, which may be a limiting factor in later cycles.},

  abstract = {Remarkable success has been achieved in the discovery of ceramic alkali superionic conductors as electrolytes in solid-state batteries; however, obtaining a stable interface between these electrolytes and electrodes is difficult. Only limited studies on the compatibility between electrodes and solid electrolytes have been reported, partially because of the need for expensive instrumentation and special cell designs. Without simple yet powerful tools, these compatibility issues cannot be systematically investigated, thus hindering the generalization of design rules for the integration of solid-state battery components. Herein, we present a methodology that combines density functional theory calculations and simple experimental techniques such as X-ray diffraction, simultaneous differential scanning calorimetry and thermal gravimetric analysis, and electrochemistry to efficiently screen the compatibility of numerous electrode/electrolyte pairs. We systemically distinguish between the electrochemical stability of the solid-state conductor, which is relevant wherever the electrolyte contacts an electron pathway, and the electrochemical stability of the electrode/electrolyte interfaces. For the solid electrolyte, we are able to computationally derive an absolute thermodynamic stability voltage window, which is small for Na3PS4 and Na3PSe4, and a larger voltage window which can be kinetically stabilized. The experimental stability, when measured with reliable techniques, falls between these thermodynamic and kinetic limits. Employing a Na solid-state system as an example, we demonstrate the efficiency of our method by finding the most stable system (NaCrO2|Na3PS4|Na{$\lnot$}\textendash Sn) within a selected chemical space (more than 20 different combinations of electrodes and electrolytes). Important selection criteria for the cathode, electrolyte, and anode in solid-state batteries are also derived from this study. The current method not only provides an essential guide for integrating all-solid-state battery components but can also significantly accelerate the expansion of the electrolyte/electrode compatibility data.}

RTILs exhibit wide electrochemical windows, making them prime candidates as media for electrochemically driven reactions such as electro-catalysis and electro-plating for separations applications. Therefore, understanding the factors determining edges of the electrochemical window, the electrochemical stability of the RTILs, and the degradation products is crucial to improve the efficiency and applicability of these systems. We present here computational investigations of the electrochemical properties of a variety of RTILs covering a wide range of electrochemical windows. We proposed four different approaches with different degrees of approximation and computational cost from gas-phase calculations to full explicit solvation models. It was found that, whereas the simplest model has significant flaws in accuracy, implicit and explicit solvent models can be used to reliably predict experimental data. The general trend of electrochemical windows of the RTILs studied is well reproduced, showing that it increases in the order of imidazolium \textbackslash textless ammonium \textbackslash textless pyrrolidinium \textbackslash textless phosphonium giving confidence to the methodology presented to use it in screening studies of ionic liquids.},

  abstract = {Crystal structures of metals are often treated as dense packing of atomic spheres. Face-centered cubic and hexagonal close-packed structures are favored in many metals. Long-period-stacking structures such as 9R are sometimes formed. However, nonclose packed structures such as body centered cubic and \$\o mega\$ are formed depending upon chemistry and process conditions. Even in metallic elements, it is a priori unknown how such close/nonclose packed structures are formed and what are their interrelationships. In the present study we show a simple algorithm for automated searching of the phase-transition pathway based upon first-principles calculations, which is applied to systematically pursue the evolution of crystal structures. Following the present algorithm, dynamical stability and interrelationships of different structures generated from a simple cubic structure are revealed for seven metallic elements. Effects of pressure are examined as well. The powerfulness of the automated method to investigate the nature of the phase transition and to predict as-yet-unknown metastable structures is demonstrated.},

All are liquid at room temperature, except the chloride salt, which has a melting point of 92 degrees C. The electrochemical characteristics of this class of ionic liquid have been determined by cyclic voltammetry. Potential windows of the ionic liquids have been obtained at glassy carbon, platinum, and gold electrodes and found to be the largest at glassy carbon, but are limited by oxidation of the thioether-functionalized cation. The voltammetry of IUPAC reference potential scale systems, ferrocene/ferrocenium, cobaltocenium/cobaltocene, and decamethylferrocene/decamethylferrocenium have been evaluated, with the last being most widely applicable. Nonadditivity of Faradaic current is found in the voltammograms of decamethylferrocene in the presence of ferrocene and cobaltocenium. Diffusion coefficient, viscosity, ionic conductivity, double layer capacitance, and other physical properties have also been measured. The dependence of the diffusion coefficient vs viscosity follows the Stokes-Einstein relationship. The properties of the ionic liquids are compared with the related imidazolium family of ionic liquids.},

There is a general presumption that simulations carried in periodic boundary conditions (PBC) are often the most appropriate to suppress boundary effects. To this end, Ewald summation has been employed to handle long ranged interactions in PBC. There has been a great deal of research targeted at improving the efficiency of Ewald summation, an O(N-2) algorithm in its traditional formulation, where N is the number of particles in the system. This paper reviews Ewald summation techniques by surveying conventional as well as state of the art efficient methods. Conventional methods, such as tabulation and approximation, are first re-examined along with an O(N-3/2) method. Fourier-based approaches which have reduced the complexity to O(N log(N)) are presented. Multipole expansion techniques, suggested as an alternative to Ewald sums, are reviewed and compared to Fourier methods. The computational efficiency of these new methods facilitates longer, larger and more realistic simulations.},

These transformations are not yet fully understood but arise from Na-ion vacancy ordering and metal oxide slab glide. In this study, we investigate the nature of vacancy ordering within the O3 host lattice framework. We generate predicted electrochemical voltage curves for each of the Na-ion intercalating layered TM oxides by using a high-throughput framework of density-functional-theory calculations. We determine a set of vacancy-ordered phases appearing as ground states in all NaxMO2 systems and investigate the energy effect of the stacking of adjacent layers.},

We demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed procedure for atomic diffusion and ionic conduction, specifically the proton conduction in a well-studied proton-conducting oxide, barium zirconate BaZrO3. The results of the demonstration study indicate that our procedure can efficiently identify the low-energy region characterizing the proton conduction in the host crystal lattice, and that the descriptors used for the statistical PES model have a great influence on the performance.},

This database contains the anisotropic work functions of more than 100 polymorphs of about 72 elements and up to a maximum Miller index of two and three for non-cubic and cubic crystals, respectively. The database has been rigorously validated against previous experimental and computational data where available. We also propose a weighted work function based on the Wulff shape that can be compared to measurements from polycrystalline specimens, and show that this weighted work function can be modeled empirically using simple atomic parameters. Furthermore, for the first time, we were able to analyze simple bond breaking rules for metallic systems beyond a maximum Miller index of one, allowing for a more generalized investigation of work function anisotropy.},

Doping the grain boundaries (GBs) of Mo with metals such as Zr or Al have previously been demonstrated as a promising approach to address this shortcoming, whereas other alloy elements are known to embrittle the GBs. In this work, we investigated the segregation and strengthening/embrittling effects of 29 metallic dopants at the {$\Sigma$}5(310) tilt and {$\Sigma$}5(100) twist Mo GBs using density functional theory (DFT) calculations and empirical continuum models. In agreement with previous works for other metals, we find that the strain, as measured by the relative metallic radius versus Mo, is a good predictor of the segregation tendency, while the difference in cohesive energies between the dopant and Mo is a good predictor of the strengthening/embrittling effect. However, we find that dopant chemistry also plays a significant role in affecting segregation behavior at GBs, particularly in driving the formation of intermetallic precipitates or 2-D interfacial phases (complexions). We also show that the site preference of a dopant in the GB can lead to strengthening effects that deviate from those predicted using simple bond-breaking arguments. Assuming a fast cleavage model of fracture, Ta, Re, Os and W are predicted to have a weak strengthening effect on Mo for the {$\Sigma$}5(310) tilt GB, and Mn, Fe, Co and Nb are predicted to have reasonable strengthening effects for the {$\Sigma$}5(100) twist GB.},

Although it is expected to be a metal under conventional band theory, electron interactions at low temperature cause it to behave like an insulator, making it difficult to accurately model its electronic properties with standard ab initio methods. As such, accurate theoretical assessments of the MIT with point defects requires special attention to the type of functionals used. In this study, we conclude that the PBE + U functional provides the best compromise between accuracy and efficiency in calculating the properties related to the MIT between low-temperature and high-temperature V2O3.

Such surface phenomena are especially important at the nanoscale, where the large surface area to volume ratios leads to properties that are significantly different from the bulk. In this work, we present the largest database of the calculated surface energies of elemental crystals to date. This database contains the surface energies of more than 100 polymorphs of about 70 elements, up to a maximum Miller index of two and three for non-cubic and cubic crystals, respectively. Well-known reconstruction schemes are also accounted for. The database is systematically improvable and has been rigorously validated against previous experimental and computational data where available. We will describe the methodology used in constructing the database, and how it can be accessed for further studies and design of materials.},

The effect of aluminum doping on layer stabilization has been investigated using a combination of techniques to measure the aluminum distribution in layered LiNi 27 7 0.8 Co 0.15 Al 0.05 O 2 (NCA) over multiple length scales with Al and Li MAS NMR, local electrode atom probe (APT) tomography, X-ray and neutron diffraction, DFT, and SQUID magnetic susceptibility measurements.

The ability to understand the complex atomic and orbital ordering around Al 3+ demonstrated in the current method will be useful for studying the local environment of Al 3+ in a range of transition metal oxide battery materials.},

Atomic layer deposition (ALD) is a critical nanofabrication technique that enables fine-tuning of atomic structure and thickness as a result of its layer-by-layer growth behavior. In this study, in situ X-ray absorption spectra of the S K-edge during ALD growth of ZnS thin films on TiO2 nanoparticles were collected and analyzed. The experimental results show that both sulfide and sulfate species form during the nucleation phase of ZnS on TiO2. As film growth proceeds, the S Kedge of the in situ ZnS film converges to that of a representative ex situ ALD ZnS film. By building representative atomistic models, a high-throughput screening method was developed to determine the most probable atomic configurations as the film structure evolves. The screening method consisted of a supervised machine learning analysis of thousands of simulated X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) spectra. Atomic-level insight was gained into changes in the coordination environment of surface species as they transitioned from the nucleation phase toward the crystalline ZnS phase. The experimental and computational strategies presented herein provide an example of how in situ synchrotron-based characterization can be leveraged using robust modeling approaches to elucidate the ordering of atoms during thin-film growth.},

Using state-of-the-art quantum-mechanical methods, we studied the direct interaction of transition-metal solutes with dislocations in molybdenum. The interaction increases dramatically with increasing electron number and strongly influences the mechanisms responsible for plasticity in these materials. Our quantitative model explains solution softening of metals by using changes in energy and stress scales of plasticity from solutes.},

However, an atomic-scale understanding of the ion conduction paths in these systems is still lacking, and this is important for developing strategies for optimization of the electrochemical properties. Here, the alkaliion transport behavior of both LiFeSO4F and NaFeSO4F are investigated by atomistic modeling methods. Activation energies for numerous ion migration paths through the complex structures are calculated. The results indicate that LiFeSO4F is effectively a three-dimensional (3D) lithium-ion conductor with an activation energy of {$\sim$}0.4 eV for long-range diffusion, which involve a combination of zigzag paths through [100], [010], and [111] tunnels in the open tavorite lattice. In contrast, for the related NaFeSO4F, only one direction ([101]) is found to have a relatively low activation energy (0.6 eV). This leads to a diffusion coefficient that is more than 6 orders of magnitude lower than any other direction, suggesting that NaFeSO4F is a one-dimensional (1D) Na-ion conductor.},

Olivine NaMPO4 (M = Fe, Fe0.5Mn0.5, Mn) and layered Na2FePO4F are interesting materials that have been reported recently as attractive positive electrodes. Here, we report their Na-ion conduction behavior and intrinsic defect properties using atomistic simulation methods. In the olivines, Na ion migration is essentially restricted to the [010] direction along a curved trajectory, similar to that of LiMPO4, but with a lower migration energy (0.3 eV). However, Na/M antisite defects are also predicted to have a lower formation energy: the higher probability of tunnel occupation with a relatively immobile M2+ cation - along with a greater volume change on redox cycling - contributes to the poor electrochemical performance of the Na-olivine. Na+ ion conduction in Na2FePO4F is predicted to be two-dimensional (2D) in the interlayer plane with a similar low activation energy. The antisite formation energy is slightly higher; furthermore, antisite occupation would not be predicted to impede transport significantly owing to the 2D pathway. This factor, along with the much lower volume change on redox cycling, is undoubtedly responsible for the better electrochemical performance of the layered structure. Where volume change and structural effects do not incur impediments, Na-ion materials may present significant advantages over their Li counterparts.},

High-entropy alloys constitute a new class of materials that provide an excellent combination of strength, ductility, thermal stability, and oxidation resistance. Although they have attracted extensive attention due to their potential applications, little is known about why these compounds are stable or how to predict which combination of elements will form a single phase. In this article, we present a review of the latest research done on these alloys focusing on the theoretical models devised during the last decade. We discuss semiempirical methods based on the Hume-Rothery rules and stability criteria based on enthalpies of mixing and size mismatch. To provide insights into the electronic and magnetic properties of high-entropy alloys, we show the results of first-principles calculations of the electronic structure of the disordered solid-solution phase based on both Korringa\textendash Kohn\textendash Rostoker coherent potential approximation and large supercell models of example face-centered cubic and body-centered cubic systems. We also discuss in detail a model based on enthalpy considerations that can predict which elemental combinations are most likely to form a single-phase high-entropy alloy. The enthalpies are evaluated via first-principles ``high-throughput'' density functional theory calculations of the energies of formation of binary compounds, and therefore it requires no experimental or empirically derived input. The model correctly accounts for the specific combinations of metallic elements that are known to form single-phase alloys while rejecting similar combinations that have been tried and shown not to be single phase.},

Besides efficiency, another critical factor for photovoltaics and other optoelectronic applications is environmental stability and photostability under operating conditions9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15. In contrast to their three-dimensional counterparts, Ruddlesden\textendash Popper phases\textemdash layered two-dimensional perovskite films\textemdash have shown promising stability, but poor efficiency at only 4.73 per cent13, 16, 17. This relatively poor efficiency is attributed to the inhibition of out-of-plane charge transport by the organic cations, which act like insulating spacing layers between the conducting inorganic slabs. Here we overcome this issue in layered perovskites by producing thin films of near-single-crystalline quality, in which the crystallographic planes of the inorganic perovskite component have a strongly preferential out-of-plane alignment with respect to the contacts in planar solar cells to facilitate efficient charge transport. We report a photovoltaic efficiency of 12.52 per cent with no hysteresis, and the devices exhibit greatly improved stability in comparison to their three-dimensional counterparts when subjected to light, humidity and heat stress tests. Unencapsulated two-dimensional perovskite devices retain over 60 per cent of their efficiency for over 2,250 hours under constant, standard (AM1.5G) illumination, and exhibit greater tolerance to 65 per cent relative humidity than do three-dimensional equivalents. When the devices are encapsulated, the layered devices do not show any degradation under constant AM1.5G illumination or humidity. We anticipate that these results will lead to the growth of single-crystalline, solution-processed, layered, hybrid, perovskite thin films, which are essential for high-performance opto-electronic devices with technologically relevant long-term stability.}

By varying the laser processing parameters and thereby the cooling rate of the melt within each library, the composition with the greatest glass-forming ability within the range studied was determined to be Cu51.7Zr36.7Ti11.6. An alternative deposition scheme was applied to fabricate libraries containing a large array of discrete compositions. Instrumented nanoindentation was performed on the discrete libraries to establish compositional trends in the measured properties. The indentation modulus was observed to be strongly correlated with the Ti-content over the entire region of study, while the hardness was more sensitive to Cu for high Zr-contents and to Ti at lower Zr-contents. These trends could inform the design of new metallic glass alloys possessing an optimized balance of both ductility and glass forming ability.},

These parameters were compared with those in various conventional face-centered cubic metals.

Correspondingly, the activation energies in the high-entropy alloys are higher than those in the reference metals. Moreover, the trend of the normalized activation energy is positively related to the number of composing elements in the matrix. A quasi-chemical model is proposed to analyze the fluctuation of lattice potential energy in different matrices and to explain the observed trend in activation energies. Greater fluctuation of lattice potential energy produces more significant atomic traps and blocks, leading to higher activation energies, and thus accounts for the sluggish diffusion in high-entropy alloys.},

In this study, the structure of phosphor has been modified through cation substitution to induce charge variation and a rearrangement of neighboring nitride clusters, and consequently enhance its luminescent behavior. Substitution of Ca2+ by Sr2+ cations expanded the lattice volume and the bc plane, but shortened the distance between the layers along the a axis. Lattice distortion of the framework introduced high-coordination sites in the Sr/Eu centers and adequate space, thereby facilitating charge variation of activators under reduced atmosphere, as detected through X-ray absorption near-edge structure spectroscopy. As such, the photoluminescent intensity of the phosphors increased by more than 10\$\textbackslash backslash\$\% and a blue shift occurred. The microstructures of the samples were also analyzed using high-resolution transmission electron microscopy. Cation substitution induced a special change in the anion environment, as indicated in the solid-state Raman spectra. Moreover, typical ordering variations in the SiN4 and AlN4 clusters are generated in the lattice. Meanwhile, neighbor sequence of (Si/Al)N4 around the divalent centers were observed through solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. The modified ordering distribution resulted in a rigid structure and improved the thermal quenching behavior. Thermal stability has been enhanced by 10\$\textbackslash backslash\$\% at 473 K when x = 0.9 in SrxCa0.993-xAlSiN3:Eu2+0.007 compared with that at x = 0.

Comparison with the experimental ionic conductivities shows that the magnitude and directionality of the interaction energy of the ion pairs play a crucial role in determining the ionic dissociation/association dynamics in the ionic liquids. The electrostatic interaction is the major source of attraction between ions. The induction contribution is small but not negligible. The hydrogen bonding with the C(2)-H of imidazolium is not essential for the attraction in the ion pair. The interaction energy of the BF(4)(-) complex with 1-ethyl-2,3-dimethylimidazolium (em2im) (-81.8 kcal/mol) is only 4\% smaller than that of the emim complex.},

Included are conductivity and Seebeck coefficient measurements at constant x, obtained by sealing off the specimen chamber after reduction. The Seebeck coefficient is independent of temperature, suggesting that the number of carriers is constant. On the other hand, the mobility is activated, with activation energy Eh = 0.40 eV at small x and increasing to 0.52 eV at x = 0.25. The results for the mobility preexponential are consistent with the adiabatic theory of small polaron behavior. A puzzling feature of the Seebeck data as a function of x is that, for low x, the data fit the well-known Heikes formula, without a degeneracy factor of 2 for spin. Nevertheless, these data are interpreted to show that the proportion of mobile carriers decreases as x increases, presumably because of the presence of short-range ordered configurations which immobilize some carriers.},

However, the precise role of the interfaces in modifying defect behavior is unclear. Using long-time simulations methods, we determine the mobility of defects and defect clusters at grain boundaries in Cu. We find that mobilities vary significantly with boundary structure and cluster size, with larger clusters exhibiting reduced mobility, and that interface sink efficiency depends on the kinetics of defects within the interface via the in-boundary annihilation rate of defects. Thus, sink efficiency is a strong function of defect mobility, which depends on boundary structure, a property that evolves with time. Further, defect mobility at boundaries can be slower than in the bulk, which has general implications for the properties of polycrystalline materials. Finally, we correlate defect energetics with the volumes of atomic sites at the boundary.},

Based on the results of temperature dependence of photoconductivity, the 5d(1) and 5d(2) levels in the Ce:YAGG are found to be located below and within the conduction band, respectively, while both levels in the Ce:YGG are found to be located within its conduction band located at lower energy levels. In addition, the threshold of photoionization from the 4f level of Ce(3+) to the conduction band in the Ce:YAGG and Ce:YGG were estimated to be 3.2, and 2.8 eV, respectively. We conclude that the main quenching process in the Ce:YAGG is caused by the thermally stimulated ionization process with activation energy of 90 meV from the 5d(1) to the conduction band, and that in the Ce:YGG is caused by the direct ionization process from the 5d levels to the conduction band.},

The high luminescence quenching temperature ({$\sim$}600 K) has been well established, but surprisingly, the mechanism for temperature quenching has not been elucidated yet. In this report we investigate the possibility of thermal ionization as a cause of this quenching process by measuring thermoluminescence (TL) excitation spectra at various temperatures. In the TL excitation (TLE) spectrum at room temperature there is no Ce3+:5d1 band (the lowest excited 5d level). However, in the TLE spectrum at 573 K, which corresponds to the onset temperature of luminescence quenching, a TLE band due to the Ce3+:5d1 excitation was observed at around 450 nm. On the basis of our observations we conclude that the luminescence quenching of YAG:Ce3+ at high temperatures is caused by the thermal ionization and not by the thermally activated cross over to the 4f ground state. The conclusion is confirmed by analysis of the positions of the 5d states of Ce3+ relative to the conduction band in the energy band diagram of YAG:Ce3+.},

Our result demonstrates a rational, simple, and systematic approach for generating accurate free-energy diagrams with reduced computational resources.

The lithium percolation properties of the three most common lithium metal oxide phases, the layered {$\alpha$}-NaFeO2 structure, the spinel-like LT-LiCoO2 structure, and the {$\gamma$}-LiFeO2 structure, are demonstrated and a strong dependence of the percolation thresholds on the cation ordering and the lithium content is observed. The poor performance of {$\gamma$}-LiFeO2-type structures is explained by their lack of percolation of good Li migration channels. The spinel-like structure exhibits excellent percolation properties that are robust with respect to off-stoichiometry and some amount of cation disorder. The layered structure is unique, as it possesses two different types of lithium diffusion channels, one of which is, however, strongly dependent on the lattice parameters, and therefore very sensitive to disorder. In general it is found that a critical Li-excess concentration exists at which Li percolation occurs, although the amount of Li excess needed depends on the partial cation ordering. In fully cation-disordered materials, macroscopic lithium diffusion is enabled by {$\approx$}10\% excess lithium.},

The modeling apportioned specific binding interactions for each CO2 molecule, including substantial cooperative binding effects among the guest molecules. The validation of the capacity of such simulations to accurately model molecular-scale binding bodes well for the theory-aided development of amine-based CO2 sorbents. The analysis shows that the combination of appropriate pore size, strongly interacting amine functional groups, and the cooperative binding of CO2 guest molecules is responsible for the low-pressure binding and large uptake of CO2 in this sorbent material.},

The spin glass state magnetoelectrically coupled to the dipolar glass state has previously been reported for SrTiO 3 substituted with only 2\% of Mn on the B-site. An analysis of the substitution mechanism for A- and B-site doping shows a strong infl uence of processing conditions, such as processing temperature, oxygen partial pressure, and off-stoichiometry. The required conditions for a site-selective substitution are defi ned, which yield a single-phase and almost defect-free perovskite. Magnetic measurements show no magnetic anomalies resulting from spin coupling and only a simple paramagnetic behavior. Magnetic anomalies are observed only for the samples in which Mn is misplaced within the cation sublattice of the SrTiO 3 perovskite. This occurs due to improper material processing, which causes initially unpredicted changes in the valence state of the Mn and results in the formation of structural defects and irregularities associated with segregation and nucleation of the magnetic species. Previously reported spin coupling in Mn-doped SrTiO 3 is not an intrinsic phenomenon and cannot be treated as a spin glass.},

  abstract = {This review contains recent developments and new insights in the research on inorganic, crystalline compounds with two different chalcogenide ions (bichalcogenides). Anion ordering is used as a parameter to form structural dimensionalities as well as local- and global-electric polarities. The reason for the electric polarity is that, in the heterogeneous bichalcogenide lattice, the individual bond-lengths between cations and anions are different from those in a homogeneous anion lattice. It is also shown that heteroleptic tetrahedral and octahedral coordinations offer a multitude of new crystal fields and coordinations for involved cations. This coordination diversity in bichalcogenides seems to be one way to surpass electro-chemical redox potentials: three oxidation states of a single transition metal can be stabilized, e.g., Ba 15 V 12 S 34 O 3 . A new type of disproportionation, related to coordination, is presented and results from chemical pressure on the bichalcogenide lattices of 3\textasciiacute ( 7/3\textasciiacute ( (La,Ce)CrS 2 O, transforming doubly [CrS 3/3 S 2/2 O 1/1 ] 5+1) into singly [CrS 4/2 S 2/3 ] 6+0) and 11/3\textasciiacute ( [CrS 4/3 O 2/1 ] 4+2) coordinations. Also, magnetic anisotropy is imposed by the anion ordering in BaCoSO, where magnetic interactions via S or O occur along two different crystallographic directions. Further, the potential of the anion lattice is discussed as a parameter for future materials design.},

  abstract = {Many multicomponent materials exhibit significant configurational disorder. Diffusing ions in such materials migrate along a network of sites that have different energies and that are separated by configuration dependent activation barriers. We describe a formalism that enables a first-principles calculation of the diffusion coefficient in solids exhibiting configurational disorder. The formalism involves the implementation of a local cluster expansion to describe the configuration dependence of activation barriers. The local cluster expansion serves as a link between accurate first-principles calculations of the activation barriers and kinetic Monte Carlo simulations. By introducing a kinetically resolved activation barrier, we show that a cluster expansion for the thermodynamics of ionic disorder can be combined with a local cluster expansion to obtain the activation barrier for migration in any configuration. This ensures that in kinetic Monte Carlo simulations, detailed balance is maintained at all times and kinetic quantities can be calculated in a properly equilibrated thermodynamic state. As an example, we apply this formalism for an investigation of lithium diffusion in LixCoO2. A study of the activation barriers in LixCoOx within the local density approximation shows that the migration mechanism and activation barriers depend strongly on the local lithium-vacancy arrangement around the migrating lithium ion. By parametrizing the activation barriers with a local cluster expansion and applying it in kinetic Monte Carlo simulations, we predict that lithium diffusion in layered LixCoO2 is mediated by divacancies at all lithium concentrations. Furthermore, due to a strong concentration dependence of the activation barrier, the predicted diffusion coefficient varies by several orders of magnitude with lithium concentration x.},

The focus is restricted to vacancy mediated diffusion in binary substitutional alloys. The approach relies on the evaluation of Kubo-Green expressions of kinetic-transport coefficients and fluctuation expressions of thermodynamic factors for a perfect crystal using Monte Carlo simulations applied to a cluster expansion of the configurational energy. We make a clear distinction between diffusion in a perfect crystal (i.e. no climbing dislocations and grain boundaries that can act as vacancy sources) and diffusion in a solid containing a continuous distribution of vacancy sources that regulate an equilibrium vacancy concentration throughout. A variety of useful metrics to characterize intermixing processes and net vacancy fluxes that can result in the Kirkendall effect are described and are analyzed in the context of thermodynamically ideal but kinetically non-ideal model alloys as well as a realistic thermodynamically non-ideal alloy. Based on continuum simulations of diffusion couples using self-consistent perfect-crystal diffusion coefficients, we show that the rate and mechanism of intermixing in kinetically non-ideal alloys is very sensitive to the density of discrete vacancy sources. \textcopyright{} 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

The process of defect identification and characterization is typically difficult and indirect, usually requiring an ingenious combination of different experimental techniques. First-principles calculations have emerged as a powerful microscopic tool that complements experiments or sometimes even serves as the sole source of atomistic information due to experimental limitations. Still, first-principles calculations based on density functional theory in the local density or generalized gradient approximations suffer from serious limitations when describing defects in solids. Recent advances in electronic structure methods, rapid increases in computing power, and the development of efficient algorithms indicate a promising future for computational defect physics. We review recent advances in the theory of defects in solids from the perspective of first-principles calculations. We focus in particular on methods that improve the description of band gaps, leading to results that can be directly compared to experiments on a quantitative level. We discuss the use of LDA\th U in wide-band-gap materials, screened hybrid functionals, the quasiparticle GW method, and the use of modified pseudopotentials. Advantages and limitations of these methods are illustrated with examples.},

Although the formalism that allows the calculation of solid state phase diagrams from first principles is well established, its practical implementation remains a tedious process. The development of a fully automated algorithm to perform such calculations serves two purposes. First, it will make this powerful tool available to large number of researchers. Second, it frees the calculation process from arbitrary parameters, guaranteeing that the results obtained are truly derived from the underlying first-principles calculations. The proposed algorithm formalizes the most difficult step of phase diagram calculations, namely the determination of the ``cluster expansion'', which is a compact representation of the configurational dependence of the alloy's energy. This is traditionally achieved by a fit of the unknown interaction parameters of the cluster expansion to a set of structural energies calculated from first-principles. We present a formal statistical basis for the selection of both the interaction parameters to include in the cluster expansion and of the structures to use in order to determine them. The proposed method relies on the concepts of cross-validation and variance minimization. An application to the calculation of the phase diagram of the Si-Ge, CaO-MgO, Ti-Al, and Cu-Au systems is presented.},

However, cluster expansion is currently unable to handle anisotropic properties, a key distinguishing feature of crystalline systems central to the design of modern epitaxial structures and devices. Here, I introduce a tensorial cluster expansion enabling the prediction of fundamental tensor-valued material properties such as elasticity, piezoelectricity, dielectric constants, optoelectric coupling, anisotropic diffusion coefficients, surface energy and stress. As an application, I develop predictive ab initio models of anisotropic properties relevant to the design and optimization of III-V semiconductor epitaxial optoelectronic devices.},

The symmetry of a distortion pathway is then uniquely defined by a distortion group involving 1*; it has the same form as a magnetic group that involves time reversal, 1'. Given its isomorphism to magnetic groups, distortion groups could potentially have commensurate impact in the study of distortions as the magnetic groups have had in the study of magnetic structures.

X-ray diffraction of charged samples indicates that high voltage charging leads to the formation of an inactive phase.},

The results show that neither Li2O2 nor Li2O are major components of the insoluble discharge products; instead, the products are composed primarily of fluorine, lithium, and carbon, with surprisingly little oxygen. The complex reaction chemistry also appears to involve the formation of ethers or alkoxide products at the expense of the carbonate solvent molecules (ethylene carbonate and dimethyl carbonate). The irreversible discharge reaction is likely electrochemically promoted with Li+, anions, and dissolved oxygen. Exactly how the molecular O2 participates in the reaction is unclear and requires further study. The addition of a conformal coating of MnO2 on the carbon lowers the cell's operating voltage but does not alter the overall discharge chemistry.},

Large-scale searches for high-performing 2D materials are limited to calculating descriptors with computationally demanding first-principles density functional theory. In this work, we alleviate this issue by extending and generalizing crystal graph convolutional neural networks to systems with planar periodicity and train an ensemble of models to predict thermodynamic, mechanical and electronic properties. We carry out a screening of nearly 45,000 structures for two separate applications: mechanical strength and photovoltaics. By collecting statistics of the screened candidates, we investigate structural and compositional design principles that impact the properties of the structures surveyed. Our approach recovers some well-accepted design rules: hybrid organic-inorganic perovskites with lead and tin tend to be good candidates for solar cell applications and titanium based MXenes usually have high stiffness coefficients. Interestingly, other members of the group 4 elements also contribute to increasing the mechanical strength of MXenes. For all-inorganic perovskites, we discover some compositions that have not been deeply studied in the field of photovoltaics and thus open up paths for further investigation. We open-source the code-base to spur further development in this space.},

  abstract = {With hydrogen being seen as a key renewable energy vector, the search for materials exhibiting fast hydrogen transport becomes ever more important. Not only do hydrogen storage materials require high mobility of hydrogen in the solid state, but the efficiency of electrochemical devices is also largely determined by fast ionic transport. Although the heavy alkaline-earth hydrides are of limited interest for their hydrogen storage potential, owing to low gravimetric densities, their ionic nature may prove useful in new electrochemical applications, especially as an ionically conducting electrolyte material. Here we show that barium hydride shows fast pure ionic transport of hydride ions (H(-)) in the high-temperature, high-symmetry phase. Although some conductivity studies have been reported on related materials previously, the nature of the charge carriers has not been determined. BaH2 gives rise to hydride ion conductivity of 0.2 S cm(-1) at 630 \textdegree C. This is an order of magnitude larger than that of state-of-the-art proton-conducting perovskites or oxide ion conductors at this temperature. These results suggest that the alkaline-earth hydrides form an important new family of materials, with potential use in a number of applications, such as separation membranes, electrochemical reactors and so on.},

OD-Cu electrodes prepared by H2 reduction of Cu2O precursors reduce CO to acetate and ethanol with nearly 50\% Faradaic efficiency at moderate overpotential. Temperature-programmed desorption of CO on OD-Cu revealed the presence of surface sites with strong CO binding that are distinct from the terraces and stepped sites found on polycrystalline Cu foil. After annealing at 350 \textdegree C, the surface-area corrected current density for CO reduction is 44-fold lower and the Faradaic efficiency is less than 5\%. These changes are accompanied by a reduction in the proportion of strong CO binding sites. We propose that the active sites for CO reduction on OD-Cu surfaces are strong CO binding sites that are supported by grain boundaries. Uncovering these sites is a first step toward understanding the surface chemistry necessary for efficient CO electroreduction.},

Battery performance, irreversible charge "loss", rate capability, cyclability, exfoliation of graphite and safety are highly dependent on the quality of the SEI. Therefore, understanding the actual nature and composition of SEI is of prime interest. If the chemistry of the SEI formation and the manner in which each component affects battery performance are understood, SEI could be tuned to improve battery performance. In this paper key points related to the nature, formation, and features of the SEI formed on carbon negative electrodes are discussed. SEI has been analyzed by various analytical techniques amongst which FTIR and XPS are most widely used. FTIR and XPS data of SEI and its components as published by many research groups are compiled in tables for getting a global picture of what is known about the SEI. This article shall serve as a handy reference as well as a starting point for research related to SEI. \{\textcopyright\} 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

The influence of the masses of the various atoms on the effective frequency is investigated. It is shown that an effective mass which depends on the direction of the path through the saddle point in configuration space determines this frequency. In the case of chemical diffusion by the vacancy mechanism the effective mass is approximately the same as the mass of the solute atom, and must always lie between the mass of the solute and the mass of the solvent. It is finally shown that the classical rate theory, even with many-body considerations, is unable to explain the recent observations of Lazarus and Okkerse on the isotope effect in the diffusion of iron in silver.},

At high temperatures these alloys show more extensive precipitation, with the precipitate morphology dependent on the heat of mixing.

All data reported are calculated without any approximation on the angular dependence of the total and orbital densities, and are calculated fully self-consistently with both scalar-relativistic and spin-orbit effects included. We have found that a semiempirical screened exchange version of the local-spin-density approximation led to a marked improvement in the interconfigurational and spin-flip energies due to the inclusion of screening effects, while ionization potentials show little improvement.},

  abstract = {A synchrotron radiation based x-ray microprobe analytical technique, x-ray beam induced current (XBIC), is suggested and demonstrated at the Advanced Light Source at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. The principle of XBIC is similar to that of electron/laser beam induced current with the difference that minority carriers are generated by a focused x-ray beam. XBIC can be combined with any other x-ray microprobe tool, such as the x-ray fluorescence microprobe (mu-XRF), to complement chemical information with data on the recombination activity of impurities and defects. Since the XBIC signal, which carries information about the recombination activity of defects in the sample, and the mu-XRF signal, which contains data on their chemical nature, can be collected simultaneously, this combination offers a unique analytical capability of in situ analysis of the recombination activity of defects and their chemical origin with a high sensitivity and a micron-scale spatial resolution. Examples of an application of this technique to multicrystalline silicon for solar cells are demonstrated. (C) 2002 American Institute of Physics.}

We distinguish between these quantities and consider their fundamental limitations and utility for understanding material properties. We discuss the nature of bonding between atoms and the techniques that have been developed for partitioning electron density. While formal oxidation states help us count electrons (in ions, bonds, lone pairs), variously defined atomic charges are usefully employed in the description of physical processes including dielectric response and electronic spectroscopies. Such partial charges are introduced as quantitative measures in simple mechanistic models of a more complex reality, and therefore may not be comparable or transferable. In contrast, oxidation states are defined to be universal, with deviations constituting exciting challenges as evidenced in mixed-valence compounds, electrides and highly correlated systems. This Perspective covers how these concepts have evolved in recent years, our current understanding and their significance.},

The scope of applications is limited due to the small thickness in the region of only tens of microns. The research effort in the past two decades, mainly pioneered by a Japanese- and a US-group of scientists, has substantially relaxed this size constrain. Some bulk metallic glasses can have tensile strength up to 3000 MPa with good corrosion resistance, reasonable toughness, low internal friction and good processability. Bulk metallic glasses are now being used in consumer electronic industries, sporting goods industries, etc. In this paper, the authors reviewed the recent development of new alloy systems of bulk metallic glasses. The properties and processing technologies relevant to the industrial applications of these alloys are also discussed here. The behaviors of bulk metallic glasses under extreme conditions such as high pressure and low temperature are especially addressed in this review. In order that the scope of applications can be broadened, the understanding of the glass-forming criteria is important for the design of new alloy systems and also the processing techniques.},

We formulate the design of molecules with specific tailored properties as performing a continuous optimization in the space of electron-nuclear attraction potentials. The optimization is facilitated by using a linear combination of atomic potentials (LCAP), a general framework that creates a continuous property landscape from an otherwise unlinked set of discrete molecular-property values. A demonstration of this approach is given for the optimization of molecular electronic polarizability and hyperpolarizability. We show that the optimal structures can be determined without enumerating and separately evaluating the characteristics of the combinatorial number of possible structures, a process that would be much slower. The LCAP approach may be used with quantum or classical Hamiltonians, suggesting possible applications to drug design and new materials discovery.},

However, achieving a Li+ conductivity in the solid state comparable to existing liquid electrolytes (\textbackslash textgreater1 mS cm-1) is particularly challenging. In this work, we reveal a fundamental relationship between anion packing and ionic transport in fast Li-conducting materials and expose the desirable structural attributes of good Li-ion conductors. We find that an underlying body-centred cubic-like anion framework, which allows direct Li hops between adjacent tetrahedral sites, is most desirable for achieving high ionic conductivity, and that indeed this anion arrangement is present in several known fast Li-conducting materials and other fast ion conductors. These findings provide important insight towards the understanding of ionic transport in Li-ion conductors and serve as design principles for future discovery and design of improved electrolytes for Li-ion batteries.},

We find that a narrow emission bandwidth is characterized by a large splitting of more than 0.1 eV between the two highest Eu2+ 4f7 bands. By incorporating this descriptor in a high throughput first principles screening of 2,259 nitride compounds, we identify five promising new nitride hosts for Eu2+-activated red-emitting phosphors that are predicted to exhibit good chemical stability, thermal quenching resistance and quantum efficiency, as well as narrow-band emission. Our findings provide important insights into the emission characteristics of rare-earth activators in phosphor hosts, and a general strategy to the discovery of phosphors with a desired emission peak and bandwidth.},

Using first-principles calculations, we identified and confirmed various chemical rules for Si-Al, O-N, and Eu activator ordering within the {$\beta$}-SiAlON structure. Through the construction of energetically favorable models based on these chemical rules, we studied the effect of oxygen content and Eu 2+ activator concentrations on the local EuN 9 activator environment, and its impact on important photoluminescence properties such as emission peak position (using the band gap as a proxy), bandwidth, and thermal quenching resistance. Increasing oxygen content is shown to lead to an increase in Eu-N bond lengths and distortion of the EuN 9 coordination polyhedron, modifying the crystal field environment of the Eu 2+ activator, and resulting in red-shifting and broadening of the emission. We also show that the calculated excited band structure of {$\beta$}-SiAlON exhibits a large gap between the 5d levels and the conduction band of the host, indicating a large barrier toward thermal ionization (\textbackslash textgreater0.5 eV) and, hence, excellent thermal quenching stability. Based on these insights, we discuss potential strategies for further composition optimization of {$\beta$}-SiAlON.},

Samples in this system were synthesized by solid state reaction of Co3O4, NiO and Li2CO3 or LiOHH2O. Their lattice parameters were determined by Rietveld refinement. High temperature drop solution calorimetry in molten 3Na2O4MoO3 and 2PbOB2O3 solvents at 974 K was performed to determine the enthalpy of formation from the constituent oxides plus oxygen and the enthalpy of mixing in the solid solution series. There are approximately linear correlations between the lattice parameters, the enthalpy of formation from oxides (Li2O, NiO and CoO) plus O2 and the Co content in the compounds. The solid solution of LiCoO2 and LiNiO2 is almost ideal, showing a small positive enthalpy of mixing. The enthalpy of formation of LiCoO2 from oxides (Li2O, NiO and CoO) and oxygen at 298 K is 142.5F1.7 kJ/mol (from sodium molybdate calorimetry) or 140.2F2.3 kJ/mol (from lead borate calorimetry). That of LiNiO2 is 56.2F1.5 kJ/mol (from sodium molybdate calorimetry) or 53.4F1.7 kJ/mol (from lead borate calorimetry). The cobalt compound is thus significantly more stable than its nickel analogue. The phase assemblage LiCoO2, Li2O and CoO is seen at a lower oxygen pressure at constant temperature than the assemblage Co3O4/CoO, reflecting the stabilization of Co(III) in the ternary Li\textendash Co\textendash O system.},

  abstract = {We present a new method for predicting the thermodynamics of thermal degradation of charged cathode materials for rechargeable Li batteries and demonstrate it on three cathode materials, LixNiO2, LixCoO2, and LixMn2O4. The decomposition of LixNiO2 is a two-step process: the first step is a kinetically controlled exothermic conversion in which the layered structure transforms to the stable spinel structure. The second step is an endothermic decomposition of the spinel into a rocksalt phase, accompanied by the loss of oxygen. The heat generation for the overall reaction from the layered to the rocksalt structure is exothermic when x \textbackslash textless 0.5 and endothermic when x \textbackslash textgreater 0.5. From the calculated phase diagram, a similar mechanism is expected for LixCoO2, but the high migration barrier for Co may inhibit the layered-to-spinel transformation and lead to decomposition into LiCoO2 and Co3O4. For the stable spinel LiMn2O4, high temperature is needed to provide enough thermodynamic driving force for its endothermic decomposition reaction. The fully charged {$\lambda$}-Mn2O4 transforms kinetically into the stable phase {$\beta$}-MnO2 first and then decomposes at elevated temperature into the lower-valence oxides, {$\alpha$}-Mn2O3 and Mn3O4. The calculated decomposition heat for the three systems is in good agreement with experiments. When present, the electrolyte can act as a sink for the oxygen released from the cathode. Although oxygen release from the cathode is generally endothermic, its combustion with the electrolyte leads to a highly exothermic reaction.},

  abstract = {Using first-principles calculations within the generalized gradient approximation GGA+U framework, we investigate several surface properties of olivine structure LiFePO4. Calculated surface energies and surface redox potentials are found to be very anisotropic. Low-energy surfaces are in the 1 0 0, 0 1 0, 0 1 1, 1 0 1, and 2 0 1 orientations of the orthorhombic structure. We find that the coordination loss of Fe atoms on the surface is energetically more unfavorable than for Li, and generally a low-energy surface has fewer Fe-O bonds affected by the surface cut. Conversely, undercoordinated Li on the surface are somehow beneficial to reduce the energy of a surface except for the twofold coordinated Li. With the calculated surface energies, we provide the thermodynamic equilibrium shape of the LiFePO4 crystal through a Wulff construction. The two low-energy surfaces 0 1 0 and 2 0 1 dominate in the Wulff shape and make up almost 85\% of the surface area. Similar calculations for FePO4 indicate a very low energy for the 0 1 0 surface of FePO4. This result suggests that surface chemistry can induce a change in the aspect ratio of the Wulff shape. Surface redox potentials for the extraction and insertion of Li from various surfaces are also investigated in this work. The Li redox potential for the 0 1 0 surface is calculated to be 2.95 V, which is significantly lower than the bulk value of 3.55 V. For several other surfaces the Li extraction potential is above the bulk potential. We also develop a simple model that can be used to predict surface energies based on the change in the coordination of Fe and Li.},

We incorporate this method into a new DFT energy correction scheme comprising a mixture of oxidation-state and composition-dependent corrections and show that many chemical systems contain unstable polymorphs that may actually be predicted stable when uncertainty is taken into account. We then illustrate how these uncertainties can be used to estimate the probability that a compound is stable on a compositional phase diagram, thus enabling better-informed assessments of compound stability.},

Computational predictions based on first principles methods can be a valuable tool in accelerating materials discovery to develop improved ceramics. It is essential to experimentally confirm the material properties of such predictions. However, materials screening rates are limited by the long processing times and the poor compositional control from volatile element loss in conventional ceramic sintering techniques. To overcome these limitations, we developed an ultrafast high-temperature sintering (UHS) process for the fabrication of ceramic materials by radiative heating under an inert atmosphere. We provide several examples of the UHS process to demonstrate its potential utility and applications, including advancements in solid-state electrolytes, multicomponent structures, and high-throughput materials screening.},

In this work, to avoid the time-consuming and laborious experiment trial, a high-throughput computational strategy based on first-principles calculations is designed for screening corrosion-resistant binary Mg alloy with intermetallics, from both the thermodynamic and kinetic perspectives. The stable binary Mg intermetallics with low equilibrium potential difference with respect to the Mg matrix are firstly identified. Then, the hydrogen adsorption energies on the surfaces of these Mg intermetallics are calculated, and the corrosion exchange current density is further calculated by a hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) kinetic model. Several intermetallics, e.g. Y3Mg, Y2Mg and La5Mg, are identified to be promising intermetallics which might effectively hinder the cathodic HER. Furthermore, machine learning (ML) models are developed to predict Mg intermetallics with proper hydrogen adsorption energy employing work function (Wf) and weighted first ionization energy (WFIE). The generalization of the ML models is tested on five new binary Mg intermetallics with the average root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.11 eV. This study not only predicts some promising binary Mg intermetallics which may suppress the galvanic corrosion, but also provides a high-throughput screening strategy and ML models for the design of corrosion-resistant alloy, which can be extended to ternary Mg alloys or other alloy systems.},

For non-transitional elements, favorable comparison is observed, while for the majority of transition elements, particularly the V, Cr, Mn, Fe, and Co group elements, significant discrepancies exist. The Bain/tetragonal distortion analysis between fcc and bcc structures shows that when one structure is stable, the other is unstable, and the higher the energy of the unstable structure, the larger the discrepancy. Through analysis of the alloying effect in binary systems, we conclude that the lattice stability of unstable structures obtained through extrapolation of first-principles calculations in binary systems is close to the SGTE lattice stability obtained by the CALPHAD method. \textcopyright{} 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

Chloride and bromide chemistries intrinsically exhibit low migration energy barriers, wide electrochemical windows, and are not constrained to previous design principles for sulfide and oxide Li-ion conductors, allowing for much greater freedom in structure, chemistry, composition, and Li sublattice for developing fast Li-ion conductors.

Methods such as ab initio molecular dynamics that work well for superionic conductors can be prohibitively expensive when used on materials that conduct lithium ions less well but are still suitable for use as interfacial coatings. We demonstrate a way to address this problem using machine-learned interatomic potentials models in the form of moment tensor potentials. To prevent the potentials from significantly deviating from density functional theory calculations, we use molecular dynamics simulations coupled with on-the-fly machine learning. This approach increases the efficiency of the calculations by 7 orders of magnitude compared to purely ab initio molecular dynamics, significantly reducing the uncertainty in calculated migration energies and improving agreement with experimentally determined activation energies. Using this approach, we identify two particularly promising materials for use as coatings in batteries as well as several others that are candidates for doping-enhanced ionic conduction.},

Wang               et al.               found that different mechanisms accommodated plasticity in a molybdenum-niobium-titanium multiprincipal element alloy (see the Perspective by Cairney). Instead of so-called ``screw'' dislocations, deformation is accommodated by multiple pathways that include ``edge'' dislocations and activation of crystallographic slip planes.

We show a desirable combination of homogeneous plastic deformability and strength in the bcc MPEA MoNbTi, enabled by the rugged atomic environment through which dislocations must navigate. Our observations of dislocation motion and atomistic calculations unveil the unexpected dominance of nonscrew character dislocations and numerous slip planes for dislocation glide. This behavior lends credence to theories that explain the exceptional high temperature strength of similar alloys. Our results advance a defect-aware perspective to alloy design strategies for materials capable of performance across the temperature spectrum.},

  abstract = {As one of the most fascinating cathode candidates for Na-ion batteries (NIBs), P2-type Na layered oxides usually exhibit various single-phase domains accompanied by different Na+/vacancy-ordered superstructures, depending on the Na concentration when explored in a limited electrochemical window. Therefore, their Na+ kinetics and cycling stability at high rates are subjected to these superstructures, incurring obvious voltage plateaus in the electrochemical profiles and insufficient battery performance as cathode materials for NIBs. We show that this problem can be effectively diminished by reasonable structure modulation to construct a completely disordered arrangement of Na-vacancy within Na layers. The combined analysis of scanning transmission electron microscopy, ex situ x-ray absorption spectroscopy, and operando x-ray diffraction experiments, coupled with density functional theory calculations, reveals that Na+/vacancy disordering between the transition metal oxide slabs ensures both fast Na mobility (10-10 to 10-9 cm2 s-1) and a low Na diffusion barrier (170 meV) in P2-type compounds. As a consequence, the designed P2-Na2/3Ni1/3Mn1/3Ti1/3O2 displays extra-long cycle life (83.9\% capacity retention after 500 cycles at 1 C) and unprecedented rate capability (77.5\% of the initial capacity at a high rate of 20 C). These findings open up a new route to precisely design high-rate cathode materials for rechargeable NIBs.},

Nitride-based phosphors, such as Sr 2 Si 5 N 8 :Eu 2+ and CaAlSiN 3 :Eu 2+ , are commonly more red-shifted in photoluminescence and have better thermal/ chemical stability than oxides. Cation substitutions are usually performed to optimize photoluminescence and thermal quenching behavior. However, the underlying mechanisms are unclear in most cases. Here we show that neighboring-cation substitution systematically controls temperature-dependent photoluminescence behavior in CaAlSiN 3 :Eu 2+ lattice. Trivalent cation substitution at the Ca 2+ site degrades the photoluminescence in hightemperature environments but achieves better thermal stability when the substituted cation turns monovalent. The neighboring-cation control of lifetime decay is also observed. A remote control effect that guides Eu 2+ activators in selective Ca 2+ sites is proposed for neighboring-cation substitution while the compositional Si 4+ /Al 3+ ratio adjusts to the valence of M n+ (n = 1-3) cation. In the remote control effect, the Eu 2+ activators are surrounded with nitride anions which neighbor with M 3+ dominant and Si 4+ /Al 3+ -equivalent coordination when M is trivalent, but shift to the site where surrounded nitride anions neighbor with M + -dominant and Si-rich coordination when M is monovalent. This mechanism can efficiently tune optical properties, especially thermal stability, and could be general to luminescent materials, which are sensitive to valence variation in local environments.},

Two substantial contributions to the error in GGA oxidation energies are identified. The first contribution originates from the overbinding of GGA in the O2 molecule and only occurs when the oxidant is O2. The second error occurs in all oxidation reactions and is related to the correlation error in 3d orbitals in GGA. Strong self-interaction in GGA systematically penalizes a reduced state with more d electrons over an oxidized state, resulting in an overestimation of oxidation energies. The constant error in the oxidation energy from the O2 binding error can be corrected by fitting the formation enthalpy of simple nontransition metal oxides. Removal of the O2 binding error makes it possible to address the correlation effects in 3d transition metal oxides with the GGA+U method. Calculated oxidation energies agree well with experimental data for reasonable and consistent values of U.},

We also aimed to identify microstructural changes in constituent particles due to anode compression, using models of permeable-impermeable coatings of graphite particles. We studied three anode materials, SL-20, GDR-6 (6 wt \% amorphous carbon coating), and GDR-14 (14 wt \% amorphous carbon coating). Four compression conditions (0, 100, 200, and 300 kg/cm2) were examined. Experimental results indicated that electrical resistivities for unpressed materials were reduced with addition of amorphous carbon coating (for unpressed materials: rhoSL-20\textbackslash textgreaterrhoGDR-6\textbackslash textgreaterrhoGDR-14). Contact resistances were reduced for SL-20 anodes by the application of pressure. Overall, the two-dimensional (2D) impermeable particle mathematical model provided reasonable agreement with the experiments for SL-20 and GDR-6 materials, indicating that coatings remain intact for these materials even at moderate pressures (100 and 200 kg/cm2). Conductivities of SL-20 and GDR-6 anodes exposed to the highest pressure (300 kg/cm2) fell short of model predictions, suggesting particle breakage. For the GDR-14 graphite, both 2D models underestimated conductivity for all processing conditions. We conclude that the 2D simulation approach is useful in determining the state of coating.},

Prussian blue and its analogs (Prussian blue analogs [PBAs]), or hexacyanoferrates, are well-known since the 18th century and have been used for hydrogen storage, cancer therapy, biosensing, seawater desalination, and sewage treatment. Owing to their unique features, PBAs are receiving increasing interest in the field of energy storage, such as their high theoretical specific capacity, ease of synthesis, as well as low cost. In this review, a general summary and evaluation of the applications of PBAs for rechargeable batteries are given. After a brief review of the history of PBAs, their crystal structure, nomenclature, synthesis, and working principle in rechargeable batteries are discussed. Then, previous works classified based on the combination of insertion cations and transition metals are analyzed comprehensively. The review includes an outlook toward the further development of PBAs in electrochemical energy storage.},

This compound adopts a rhombohedral structure, space group R-3c, with O and F sharing one site, and was synthesized by high-energy ball-milling. The thermal stability of VO2F, which is related to the battery safety, is studied by in situ XRD upon heating and by thermal gravimetric analysis. VO2F is found to be stable up to 160 \textdegree C under inert atmosphere; above this temperature, it converts into vanadium oxide with fluorine loss. The structure evolution upon lithium cycling was studied by ex situ X-ray diffraction and absorption techniques. The results show that lithiation of VO2F goes through a solid-solution reaction, and the rhombohedral structure is preserved if no more than one lithium ion is intercalated. Upon a second Li insertion, an irreversible transition to a rock-salt structure occurs. We show using first-principles calculations that this irreversible transformation can be explained by an asymmetric energetic preference between the rhombohedral and rock-salt forms of LixVO2F, which result in large thermodynamic driving forces to convert to the rock-salt structure at x \textbackslash textgreater 1 and relatively small thermodynamic driving forces to convert back to the rhombohedral structure when delithiating to x \textbackslash textless 1.},

The LiPF6 salt in conventional electrolytes is chemically unstable, which accelerates transition metal dissolution of the electrode material, yet beneficially suppresses oxidative dissolution of the aluminium current collector; replacing LiPF6 with more stable lithium salts may diminish transition metal dissolution but unfortunately encounters severe aluminium oxidation. Here we report an electrolyte design that can solve this dilemma. By mixing a stable lithium salt LiN(SO2F)2 with dimethyl carbonate solvent at extremely high concentrations, we obtain an unusual liquid showing a three-dimensional network of anions and solvent molecules that coordinate strongly to Li(+) ions. This simple formulation of superconcentrated LiN(SO2F)2/dimethyl carbonate electrolyte inhibits the dissolution of both aluminium and transition metal at around 5 V, and realizes a high-voltage LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4/graphite battery that exhibits excellent cycling durability, high rate capability and enhanced safety.},

In this work, we used in situ strain-gauge measurement to probe the total volume change during charging and discharging of five 50 Ah-class lithium-ion cells with graphite anodes and LiCoO2 cathodes. Some interesting phenomena concerning the correlation of the taper voltage with the strain change at the end of the charge were found in the strain trend curve. To explain these phenomena, we examined the strain change of a commercial 0.65 Ah-class lithium-ion polymer cell with the same electrodes as a function of taper voltage by using in situ load-cell measurement and were able to deduce that the cell-volume change during charging correlated to the structure transition of the LiCoO2 cathode from the initial hexagonal phase ?H1? to a new hexagonal phase ?H2? at a taper voltage near 4.00 V.We conclude that the taper voltage should be maintained below 4.00 V to maximize the cycle life of lithium-ion cells with graphite anodes and LiCoO2 cathodes during practical satellite operation.},

In this paper, we propose a precipitation model for the formation of these phases and demonstrate that the anisotropic surface energies govern the observed zeta-phase morphology. The energetics and zetaphase microstructure for other group VB carbides were found to be similar. In contrast, multiphase hafnium nitrides can form both thin-lath-based microstructure as well as large, single zeta-phase grains. The difference between hafnium nitride and the group VB carbides is attributed to the relative bulk free energies and low-temperature stability between the phases.},

  abstract = {This review summarizes the phase stability in the group IVB (Ti-C; Zr-C; Hf-C) and group VB (V-C; Nb-C; Ta-C) transition-metal carbides. The order parameter functional (OPF) method and density functional theory (DFT) method have been used to predict phase equilibria in these systems. Extensive experimental investigations have attempted to determine both phase stability as a function of composition as well the crystal structures present using X-ray diffraction, neutron diffraction, electron backscatter detection, and selected area electron diffraction. These investigations have demonstrated that the structures that form are based on the close-packing of the metal atoms and the arrangement of the carbon atoms in the octahedral interstices. In general, the rocksalt B1 phase is stable for all of the transition-metal carbides, with their substoichiometry tolerance increasing with temperature; vanadium carbide is the exception due to its negative vacancy formation energy. Vacancy-ordered M6C5 phases have been predicted and experimentally confirmed in both groups of carbides; however, kinetic limitations often inhibit the formation of vacancy-ordered phases, which has contributed to controversy in phase identification. The vacancy-ordered M4C3 phase has been predicted for select carbides and has only been observed in zirconium carbide. In contrast, the stacking fault phase f-M4C3\`Ax has been readily reported in the group VB carbides (but not in the group IVB carbides). The vacancy-ordered M3C2 has been predicted by DFT for the group IVB carbides but not in the group VB carbides, whereas OPF predicts its stability in both carbides. Vacancy-ordered M3C2 phases have been experimentally observed in the Ti-C and Hf-C systems. Finally, the M2C phase has been predicted in both group carbides, except for hafnium carbide, with an order-disorder transition with temperature. These factors result in phase diagrams that are similar among all the carbides, but each phase diagram is unique due to subtle differences in bonding that result in slight differences in thermodynamically stable phases.},

We demonstrate that such methods enable well-behaved exchange-correlation approximations in very flexible model spaces, thus avoiding the overfitting found when standard least-squares methods are applied to high-order polynomial expansions. A general-purpose density functional for surface science and catalysis studies should accurately describe bond breaking and formation in chemistry, solid state physics, and surface chemistry, and should preferably also include van der Waals dispersion interactions. Such a functional necessarily compromises between describing fundamentally different types of interactions, making transferability of the density functional approximation a key issue. We investigate this trade-off between describing the energetics of intramolecular and intermolecular, bulk solid, and surface chemical bonding, and the developed optimization method explicitly handles making the compromise based on the directions in model space favored by different materials properties. The approach is applied to designing the Bayesian error estimation functional with van der Waals correlation (BEEF\textendash vdW), a semilocal approximation with an additional nonlocal correlation term. Furthermore, an ensemble of functionals around BEEF\textendash vdW comes out naturally, offering an estimate of the computational error. An extensive assessment on a range of data sets validates the applicability of BEEF\textendash vdW to studies in chemistry and condensed matter physics. Applications of the approximation and its Bayesian ensemble error estimate to two intricate surface science problems support this.},

We have found that up to 5\% of Mo can substitute V upon hydrothermal synthesis at 180 \textdegree C with further annealing at 550 \textdegree C. The substitution is confirmed by the increase of the unit cell volume with Mo content. A combination of X-ray absorption and photoelectron spectroscopy, magnetic studies, and density functional theory calculations indicates an Mo 6+ oxidation state which is charge compensated by reduction of the same amount of V to 4+. Mo- substituted samples show much smaller particle size as compared to unsubstituted {$\epsilon$}-VOPO4 and significantly improved electrochemical behavior. {$\epsilon$}-V0.95Mo0.05OPO4 shows the initial reversible capacity {$\sim$}250 mAh/g ({$\sim$}1.6 Li) and {$\sim$}80\% retention for up to 20 cycles at C/25. Sloping voltage profile, faster kinetics, and lower voltage hysteresis of Mo substituted VOPO4 are demonstrated by the galvanostatic intermittent titration technique. This enhanced electrochemical performance is attributed to the smaller particles and possible existence of partial LixMoyV1-yOPO4 solid solution supported by X-ray diffraction, which leads to less abrupt and completely reversible structure changes upon Li cycling evidenced by X-ray absorption spectroscopy.},

Electrolytes containing LiTFSI salt, with or without LiPF6 , exhibit about 100-fold higher exchange current density under otherwise identical conditions. This anion group effect is explained using molecular dynamics simulations to identify preferred solvation structures, density functional theory calculations of their binding energies and Raman spectroscopy confirmation of solvation structure. We show that TFSI preferentially solvates Li + compared to PF6 - , and yet its preferred solvation structures provide a lower Li + binding energy, suggesting a lower desolvation energy consistent with ultrafast interfacial kinetics.},

The stability against lithium metal is of practical interest for long-term stability of SSB utilizing argyrodites. Here, data on the stability of Li6PS5X (X=Cl, Br, I) in contact with Li metal are reported, obtained from an in situ X-ray photoemission technique in combination with time-resolved impedance spectroscopy. In contact with Li metal, Li6PS5X decomposes into an interphase composed of Li3P, Li2S and LiX, which serves as an SEI and results in an increasing interfacial resistance. The growth of the SEI and the resulting resistance evolution is further analyzed in terms of its kinetics and is compared to other thiophosphate superionic conductors. Li6PS5I is found to show particularly strong SEI formation with severe resistance growth.},

Impedance spectroscopy is used to probe interactions between the new superionic conductor and lithium metal revealing a more favorable decomposition than previous metal containing electrolytes. Due to the enhanced compatibility of Li10SiP2S12 with lithium metal, we present one of the longest cycling bulk solid-state lithium metal batteries to date. Discerning the nature of chemical decomposition at the electrolyte-lithium interface is essential to the design and synthesis of future solid electrolytes.},

The lithium and Ni-MeH battery technologies are less than 40 years old and have taken over the electronics industry and are on the same track for the transportation industry and the utility grid. In this review, energy storage from the gigawatt pumped hydro systems to the smallest watt-hour battery are discussed, and the future directions predicted. If renewable energy, or even lower cost energy, is to become prevalent energy storage is a critical component in reducing peak power demands and the intermittent nature of solar and wind power. An electric economy will demand more electrification of the transportation sector and it is likely that all vehicles sold by the end of this decade will have some level of hybridization. Energy storage capabilities in conjunction with the smart grid are expected to see a massive leap forward over the next 25 years.},

Representing the input structure in a way that best reflects such correlations makes it possible to improve the accuracy of the model for a given amount of reference data. When using a description of the structures that is transparent and well-principled, optimizing the representation might reveal insights into the chemistry of the data set. Here we show how one can generalize the SOAP kernel to introduce a distance-dependent weight that accounts for the multi-scale nature of the interactions, and a description of correlations between chemical species. We show that this improves substantially the performance of ML models of molecular and materials stability, while making it easier to work with complex, multi-component systems and to extend SOAP to coarse-grained intermolecular potentials. The element correlations that give the best performing model show striking similarities with the conventional periodic table of the elements, providing an inspiring example of how machine learning can rediscover, and generalize, intuitive concepts that constitute the foundations of chemistry.},

  abstract = {Crystalline porous materials have a variety of uses, such as for catalysis and separation. Identifying suitable materials for a given application can, in principle, be done by screening material databases. Such a screening requires automated high-throughput analysis tools that calculate structural properties for all materials contained in a database so they can be compared with search queries, grouped or classified. One important aspect of the structural analysis of materials such as zeolites and metal organic frameworks is the investigation of the geometrical parameters describing pores. Here, we present algorithms and tools to efficiently calculate some of these important parameters. Our tools are based on the Voronoi decomposition, which for a given arrangement of atoms in a periodic domain provides a graph representation of the void space. The resulting Voronoi network is analyzed to obtain the diameter of the largest included sphere and the largest free sphere, which are two geometrical parameters that are frequently used to describe pore geometry. Accessibility of nodes in the network is also determined for a given guest molecule and the resulting information is later used to retrieve dimensionality of channel systems as well as in Monte Carlo sampling of accessible surfaces and volumes. The presented algorithms are implemented in a software tool, Zeo++, which includes a modified version of the Voro++ library. We present example applications of our algorithms and tools using zeolite frameworks currently listed in the Atlas of Zeolite Frameworks.},

Experimental investigations indicated that Rb4O6 is a magnetically frustrated insulator. The frustration is explained here by electronic structure calculations that incorporate the correlation between the oxygen 2p electrons and deal with the mixed-valent oxygen. This leads to a physical picture where the symmetry is reduced because one third of the oxygen in Rb4O6 is nonmagnetic while the remaining two thirds assemble in antiferromagnetic arrangements. A degenerate, insulating ground state with a large number of frustrated noncollinear magnetic configurations is confidently deduced from the theoretical point of view. These findings demonstrate in general the importance of electron-electron correlations in open-shell p-electron systems.},

Using such techniques,we investigate the structural stability, intercalation energies, and battery voltagesof the two observed ordered phases ("layered" and cubic) ofLiCoO2. We perform calculations for not only fully lithiated LiCoO2,but also fully delithiated CoO2 and partially delithiated Li0.5CoO2. Ourcalculations demonstrate that removal of Li from the cubic phaseresults in movement of the Li atoms from their originaloctahedral sites to tetrahedral sites, forming a low-energy LiCo2O4 spinelstructure. The energetics of the spinel phase are shown toaccount for the observed marked differences in battery voltages betweenthe cubic and layered phases of LiCoO2. A small energybarrier exists for Li motion between octahedral and tetrahedral sites,thus indicating the metastability of the high-energy octahedral sites. Finally,we point out a possible pressure-induced layered cubic transitionin LiCoO2. \textcopyright 1998 The Electrochemical Society, Inc.},

Carbon layers on TiO2 play an important role of inhibiting the growth of Na4Ti5O12 particles. Li ions are reversibly de/intercalated in the Na4Ti5O12 structure, and this shows the reversible capacity of ca. 100 mA h g-1 with no capacity fading over 100 cycles. During the repeated charge and discharge, the ion exchange between Na ion and Li ion happens to form LixNa4-xTi5O12, and this causes an increase of the relative tunnel size due to smaller Li ion, resulting in decreasing polarization of voltage profiles. Also, trigonal Na4Ti5O12 was additionally examined as an anode for Na ion batteries.},

The advantages of backpropagation have made it the~de facto~training method for large-scale neural networks, so this deficiency constitutes a major impediment. Here we introduce a hybrid in situ\textendash in silico algorithm,~called physics-aware training, that applies backpropagation to train controllable physical systems. Just as deep learning realizes computations with deep neural networks made from layers of mathematical functions, our approach allows us to train deep~physical neural networks~made from layers of controllable physical systems, even when the physical layers lack any mathematical isomorphism to conventional artificial neural network layers. To demonstrate the universality of our approach, we train diverse physical neural networks based on optics, mechanics and electronics to experimentally perform audio and image classification tasks. Physics-aware training combines the scalability of backpropagation with the automatic mitigation of imperfections and noise achievable with~in situ~algorithms.~Physical neural networks have the potential to perform machine learning faster and more energy-efficiently than conventional electronic processors and, more broadly, can endow physical systems with automatically designed physical functionalities, for example, for robotics               23\textendash 26               , materials               27\textendash 29               and smart sensors               30\textendash 32               .},

  abstract = {In this work, we investigated the interface between the sodium anode and the sulfide-based solid electrolytes Na3SbS4 (NAS), Na3PS4 (NPS), and Cl-doped NPS (NPSC) in all-solid-state-batteries (ASSBs). Even though these electrolytes have demonstrated high ionic conductivities in the range of 1 mS cm\textendash 1 at ambient temperatures, sulfide sold-state electrolytes (SSEs) are known to be unstable with Na metal, though the exact reaction mechanism and kinetics of the reaction remain unclear. We demonstrate that the primary cause of capacity fade and cell failure is a chemical reaction spurred on by electrochemical cycling that takes place at the interface between the Na anode and the SSEs. To investigate the properties of the Na-solid electrolyte interphase (SSEI) and its effect on cell performance, the SSEI was predicted computationally to be composed of Na2S and Na3Sb for NAS and identified experimentally via X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). These two compounds give the SSEI mixed ionic- and electronic-conducting properties, which promotes continued SSEI growth, which increases the cell impedance at the expense of cell performance and cycle life. The SSEI for NPS was similarly found to be comprised of Na2S and Na3P, but XPS analysis of Cl-doped NPS (NPSC) showed the presence of an additional compound at the SSEI, NaCl, which was found to mitigate the decomposition of NPS. The methodologies presented in this work can be used to predict and optimize the electrochemical behavior of an all-solid-state cell. Such joint computational and experimental efforts can inform strategies for engineering a stable electrolyte and SSEI to avoid such reactions. Through this work, we call for more emphasis on SSE compatibility with both anodes and cathodes, essential for improving the electrochemical properties, longevity, and practicality of Na-based ASSBs.},

Each PGM can efficiently promote unique reactions, and therefore, alloying PGMs would create ideal catalysts for complex or multistep reactions that involve several reactants and intermediates. Thus, high-entropy-alloy (HEA) nanoparticles (NPs) of all six PGMs (denoted as PGM-HEA) having a great variety of adsorption sites on their surfaces could be ideal candidates to catalyze complex reactions. Here, we report for the first time PGM-HEA and demonstrate that PGM-HEA efficiently promotes the ethanol oxidation reaction (EOR) with complex 12-electron/12-proton transfer processes. PGM-HEA shows 2.5 (3.2), 6.1 (9.7), and 12.8 (3.4) times higher activity than the commercial Pd/C, Pd black and Pt/C catalysts in terms of intrinsic (mass) activity, respectively. Remarkably, it records more than 1.5 times higher mass activity than the most active catalyst to date. Our findings pave the way for promoting complex or multistep reactions that are seldom realized by mono- or bimetallic catalysts.},

As size di erences between the cations are increased, the layered a -NaFeO structure is stabilized. The LiMnO2 and low-temperature LiCoO2 structures are found to be stable only in a narrow region of parameter space.

Its high ionic conductivity of 6.6 \texttimes{} 10-5\,S\,cm-1 at ambient temperature, several orders of magnitude higher than oxide coatings, is attributed to abundant Na vacancies and cooperative MCl6 rotation, resulting in an extremely low interfacial impedance.

Detailed TEM analysis reveals, for the first time, a complex coreshell-surface structure of the particles in both materials that was not previously detected by XRD. Structural comparison indicates that the overcharged LixNi0.8Co0.15Al0.05O2 (x \textbackslash textless 0.15) particles consist of a rhombohedral core, a spinel shell, and a rock-salt structure at the surface, while the overcharged LixNi1/3Co1/3Mn1/3O2 consists of a similar coreshell-surface structure but a very different CdI2-type surface structure. The thermal instability of LixNi0.8Co0.15Al0.05O2 can be attributed to the release of oxygen because of the rapid growth of the rock-salt-type structure on the surface during heating. In contrast, the CdI2-type surface structure of the overcharged LixNi1/3Co1/3Mn1/3O2 particles delays the oxygen-release reaction to a much higher temperature resulting in better stability. These results gave deep insight into the relationship between the local structural changes and the thermal stability of cathode materials, which is vital to the development of new cathode materials for the next generation of lithium-ion batteries.},

Their physical and chemical properties are closely related to the structure and composition. In particular, Ce3+-doped garnet phosphors have a long history and are widely applied, ranging from flying spot cameras, lasers and phosphors in fluorescent tubes to more recent applications in white light LEDs, as afterglow materials and scintillators for medical imaging. Garnet phosphors are unique in their tunability of the luminescence properties through variations in the \{A\}, [B] and (C) cation sublattice. The flexibility in phosphor composition and the tunable luminescence properties rely on design and synthesis strategies for new garnet compositions with tailor-made luminescence properties. It is the aim of this review to discuss the variation in luminescence properties of Ce3+-doped garnet materials in relation to the applications. This review will provide insight into the relation between crystal chemistry and luminescence for the important class of Ce3+-doped garnet phosphors. It will summarize previous research on the structural design and optical properties of garnet phosphors and also discuss future research opportunities in this field. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

The cosubstitution is shown to be restricted to tetrahedral sites, which enables the tuning of luminescent properties. The emission peaks shift from 513 to 538 nm with a decreasing Stokes shift, which has been simulated by a crystal-field model. The correlation between the 5d crystal-field splitting of Eu(2+) ions and the local geometry structure of the substituted sites is also revealed.

  abstract = {Li2MnO3 component plays a key role in Li-rich Mn-based layered materials (mLi2MnO3{$\cdot$}nLiMO2, M = Mn, Ni, Co, etc.) for achieving unusually high lithium storage capacity. However, detailed lithium storage mechanism in Li2MnO3, such as structure evolution and charge compensation are still not very clear. In this work, the redox mechanism, the delithiation process, the kinetics of lithium diffusion, and the oxygen stability of Li2MnO3 are investigated through density functional calculations. The ground-state Li/vacancy configurations of Li2-xMnO3(0 {$\leq$} x {$\leq$} 1) at five Li concentrations are determined, from which the delithiation potential is calculated as {$\sim$}4.6 V vs Li+/Li, and the charge compensation during Li removal is contributed mainly by oxygen. According to the Li/vacancy configuration in each ground state, the sequence of lithium removal is suggested from an energetic view. Both the Li+ in the lithium layer and in the transition-metal layer can be extracted. The first-principles molecular dynamics (FPMD) simulations indicate that the lithium layer is the main diffusion plane in this material, while the Li+ in the transition-metal LiMn2 layer can migrate into the lithium layer first, and then diffuse through the lithium plane or move back to the LiMn2 layer. The energy barriers of such migrations are in the range of 0.51-0.84 eV, according to the calculations with the nudged elastic band method. The release of O2 gas from Li2-xMnO3(0 {$\leq$} x {$\leq$} 1) happens spontaneously if x {$\geq$} 0.5, from the point of view of enthalpy change. Further understanding on the evolution of oxygen in Li2-xMnO3 with x {$\geq$} 0.5 is needed to find a way to stabilize the structure during electrochemical cycles.},

  abstract = {Theeffects of various properties of nonaqueous electrolytes on the performanceof lithium/air batteries are investigated. The performance of a lithium/airbattery is determined by the number of triphase regions formedby oxygen, electrolyte, and active carbons (with catalyst). The oxygendiffusion rate through the open channels (strongly related to thepolarity of the electrolyte) is several orders of magnitude largerthan that through the liquid electrolyte; therefore, the electrolyte polarityis the most important factor on the performance of lithium/airbatteries compared with other properties of the electrolyte, such asoxygen solubility, viscosity, and ionic conductivity. The quantity of theelectrolyte added to a cell also significantly affects the dischargeperformance of the lithium/air battery, and a clear maximum incapacity is observed as a function of the electrolyte amount.The addition of tris(pentafluorophenyl)borane as a functional additive and cosolventin electrolytes can help dissolve partial Li2O and Li2O2 formedduring the battery discharge process, which is beneficial to increasingthe discharge capacity. However, this addition also largely reduces thecontact angle and increases the electrolyte viscosity, thus decreasing thedischarge capacity of the lithium/air battery. \textcopyright 2009 The Electrochemical Society},

Characterization by high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) and electron diffraction (ED) reveal that the as-prepared LiCoO2 nanoplates are covered with many cracks and have exposed (001) planes. The electrochemical performance of the LiCoO2 nanoplates was investigated by galvanostatic tests. The capacity of LiCoO2 nanoplates stabilized at 123 mA{$\cdot$}h/g at a rate of 100 mA/g and 113 mA{$\cdot$}h/g at a rate of 1000 mA/g after 100 cycles. The excellent rate capability of the LiCoO2 nanoplates results from cracks which are perpendicular to the (001) plane and favor fast Li+ transportation. In addition, compared with other methods of synthesis of LiCoO2 the time of the solid reaction state is significantly shorter even at relatively low temperatures, which means the energy consumption in preparing LiCoO2 is greatly decreased. The controllable synthesis of LiCoO2 nanoplates with exposed (001) plane paves an effective way to develop layered cathode materials with high rate capabilities for use in Li-ion batteries.},

Our recent work has involved the utilization of band structure in various topics of TE research, i.e., the band convergence, the conductive network, dimensionality reduction by quantum effects, and high throughput material screening. In non-cubic chalcopyrite compounds, we revealed the relations between structural factors and band degeneracy, and a simple unity-{$\eta$} rule was proposed for selecting high performance diamond-like TE materials. Based on the deep understanding of the electrical and thermal transport, we identified the conductive network in filled skutterudites with the ``phonon glass-electron crystal'' (PGEC) paradigm, and extended this concept to caged-free Cu-based diamond-like compounds. By combining the band structure calculations and the Boltzmann transport theory, we conducted a high-throughput material screening in half-Heusler (HH) systems, and several promising compositions with high power factors were proposed out of a large composition collection. At last, we introduced the Rashba spin-splitting effect into thermoelectrics, and its influence on the electrical transport properties was discussed. This review demonstrated the importance of the microscopic perspectives for the optimization and design of novel TE materials.},

  abstract = {Understanding the dynamical processes that govern the performance of functional materials is essential for the design of next generation materials to tackle global energy and environmental challenges. Many of these processes involve the dynamics of individual atoms or small molecules in condensed phases, e.g. lithium ions in electrolytes, water molecules in membranes, molten atoms at interfaces, etc., which are difficult to understand due to the complexity of local environments. In this work, we develop graph dynamical networks, an unsupervised learning approach for understanding atomic scale dynamics in arbitrary phases and environments from molecular dynamics simulations. We demonstrate that learning the local dynamics of atoms can be significantly easier than the global dynamics of the entire material system using a toy system. We also apply the method to learn the dynamics of two different systems -- silicon atoms at liquid-solid interfaces, and lithium ions in amorphous polymer electrolytes, and show that our approach gains important dynamical information that is otherwise difficult to obtain. With the large amounts of molecular dynamics data generated everyday in nearly every aspect of materials design, this approach provides a broadly useful, automated tool to understand atomic scale dynamics in material systems.},

With this issue as the focal point, we present a new Machine Learning approach called bpopNN for obtaining efficient approximations to DFT PESs. The methodology is based on approaching the true DFT energy as a function of electron populations on atoms, which may be realized in practice with constrained DFT (CDFT). The new approach creates approximations to this function with deep neural networks. These approximations thereby incorporate electronic information naturally into a ML approach, and optimizing the model energy with respect to populations allows the electronic terms to self-consistently adapt to the environment, as in DFT. We confirm the effectiveness of this approach with a variety of calculations on Li\$\_n\$H\$\_n\$ clusters.},

This is a principal reason that stainless steels and other chromium-containing alloys are used in critical applications ranging from biomedical implants to nuclear reactor components9,10. Unravelling the compositional dependence of this electrochemical behaviour is a long-standing unanswered question in corrosion science. Herein, we develop a percolation theory of alloy passivation based on two-dimensional to three-dimensional crossover effects that accounts for selective dissolution and the quantity of metal dissolved during the initial stage of passive film formation. We validate this theory both experimentally and by kinetic Monte Carlo simulation. Our results reveal a path forward for the design of corrosion-resistant metallic alloys.},

The importance of explicitly treating at least one solvent molecule interacting with EC during oxidation (removal of an electron) on the EC oxidation potential and decomposition reactions was shown by comparing oxidation of EC and EC(2). Accuracy of DFT results was evaluated by comparing with MP4 and G4 values for oxidation of EC. The polarized continuum model (PCM) was used to implicitly include the rest of the surrounding solvent. The oxidation potentials of EC(2) and EC(4) were found to be significantly lower than the intrinsic oxidation potential of an isolated EC and also lower than the oxidation potential of EC-BF(4)(-). The exothermic proton abstraction from the ethylene group of EC by the carbonyl group of another EC was responsible for the decreased oxidative stability of EC(2) and EC(4) compared to EC. The most exothermic path with the smallest barrier for EC(2) oxidation yielded CO(2) and an ethanol radical cation. The reaction paths with the higher barrier yielded oligo(ethylene carbonate) suggesting a pathway for the experimentally observed poly(ethylene carbonate) formation of EC-based electrolytes at cathode surfaces.},

(DFT) at the level of B3LYP/6-311++G(d), both in the gas phase and in solvent. The calculated results indicate that PC is initially oxidized on the cathode to a radical cation intermediate, PC center dot+, and then decomposes through three pathways, generating carbon dioxide CO2 and radical cations. These radical cations prefer to be reduced on the anode or by gaining one electron from PC, forming propanal, acetone, or relevant radicals. The radicals terminate by forming final products, including trail -2-ethyl-4-methyl-1,3-dioxolane, cis-2-ethyl-4-methyl-1,3-dioxolane, and 2,5-dimethyl-1,4-dioxane.

  abstract = {The absolute energy positions of conduction and valence band edges were compiled for about 50 each semiconducting metal oxide and metal sulfide minerals. The relationships between energy levels at mineral semiconductor-electrolyte interfaces and the activities of these minerals as a catalyst or photocatalyst in aqueous redox reactions are reviewed. The compilation of band edge energies is based on experimental flatband potential data and complementary empirical calculations from electronegativities of constituent elements. Whereas most metal oxide semiconductors have valence band edges 1 to 3 eV below the H2O oxidation potential (relative to absolute vacuum scale), energies for conduction band edges are close to, or lower than, the H2O reduction potential. These oxide minerals are strong photo-oxidation catalysts in aqueous solutions, but are limited in their reducing power. Non-transition metal sulfides generally have higher conduction and valence band edge energies than metal oxides; therefore, valence band holes in non-transition metal sulfides are less oxidizing, but conduction band electrons are exceedingly reducing. Most transition-metal sulfides, however, are characterized by small band gaps (\textbackslash textless1 eV) and band edges situated within or close to the H2O stability potentials. Hence, both the oxidizing power of the valence band holes and the reducing power of the conduction band electrons are lower than those of non-transition metal sulfides.},

However, the existing design principles are mainly proposed from the perspective of crystal structures. In this work, the face-centered cubic (               fcc               ) anion sublattices were creatively constructed to study the effects of anion charge and lattice volume on the stability of lithium ion occupation and lithium ion migration by the density functional theory calculations. Both the large negative anion charges and large lattice volumes would increase the relative stabilities of lithium-anion tetrahedron, making lithium ions prefer to occupy the tetrahedral sites. For a tetrahedral lithium ion migration to its adjacent tetrahedral site through an octahedral transition state, the smaller the negative anion charge is, the lower the lithium ion migration barrier will be. While for an octahedral lithium ion migration to its adjacent octahedral site through a tetrahedral transition state, the more negative anion charge is, the lower the lithium ion migration barrier will be. New design principles for developing and optimizing superionic conductors with the               fcc               anion sublattice were proposed. Low lithium ion migration barriers would be achieved by adjusting the non-lithium elements within the same crystal structure to obtain the desired electronegativity difference between the anion element and the non-lithium cation element.},

  abstract = {Lithium-oxygen has one of the highest specific energies among known electrochemical couples and holds the promise of substantially boosting the specific energy of portable batteries. Mechanistic information of the oxygen reduction reaction by Li (Li-ORR) is scarce, and the factors limiting the discharge and charge efficiencies of the Li-oxygen cathode are not understood. To shed light on the fundamental surface chemistry of Li-ORR, we have performed periodic density functional theory calculations in conjunction with thermodynamic modeling for two metal surfaces, Au(111) and Pt(111). On clean Au(111) initial O(2) reduction via superoxide (LiO(2)) formation has a low reversible potential of 1.51 V. On clean Pt(111), the dissociative adsorption of O(2) is facile and the reduction of atomic O has a reversible potential of 1.97 V, whereas the associative channel involving LiO(2) is limited by product stability versus O to 2.04 V. On both surfaces O(2) lithiation significantly weakens the O-O bond, so the product selectivity of the Li-ORR is monoxide (Li(x)O), not peroxide (Li(x)O(2)). Furthermore, on both surfaces Li(x)O species are energetically driven to form (Li(x)O)(n) aggregates, and the interface between (Li(x)O)(n) and the metal surfaces are active sites for forming and dissociating LiO(2). Given that bulk Li(2)O((s)) is found to be globally the most stable phase up to 2.59 V, the presence of available metal sites may allow the cathode to access the bulk Li(2)O phase across a wide range of potentials. During cycling, the discharge process (oxygen reduction) is expected to begin with the reduction of chemisorbed atomic O instead of gas-phase O(2). On Au(111) this occurs at 2.42 V, whereas the greater stability of O on Pt(111) limits the reversible potential to 1.97 V. Therefore, the intrinsic reactivity of Pt(111) renders it less effective for Li-ORR than Au(111).},

A relationship was established between the cation/anion structure and melting point as well as solubility of these salts. In order to obtain a detailed view about the effect of onium cation structure on its stability in capacitor application, we investigated the electrochemical stability window of the nonaqueous electrolytes based on these salts, using both a conventional stability window determination and a new approach especially defined for capacitor-like applications.},

The high conductivities are due to the high fluidity and ionicity rather than some sort of Grotthus mechanism, although in certain cases a mobile proton population may make a non-negligible contribution. The highest conductivities have been obtained when both cations and anions contain protons. At 25 degrees C, values of \textbackslash textgreater150 millisiemens per centimeter (mS x cm(-1)) appear possible; at 100 degrees C, 470 mS x cm(-1) has been measured.

Li ions in stoichiometric LiMn2O4 sample are electrochemically extracted in sodium containing electrolyte solution, forming LixMn2O4 (x = 0.1) by first oxidation process. Sodium ions are inserted into the lithium extracted spinel phase, which results in the phase transition. From structural analysis by X-ray diffraction and phase transition behavior in the sodium cells, it is found that an original spinel phase in part converts into a layered phase, NayMnO2. Thus prepared NayMnO2 can deliver approximately 190\textendash 200 mAh g-1 of reversible capacity with relatively good capacity retention as positive electrode materials for rechargeable sodium batteries. Nonstoichiometric Li-rich manganese spinel, Li[Li0.2Mn1.8]O4, also accommodates the sodium ions, similarly to the stoichiometric phase. However, phase transition to the layered phase is not observed. Instead, the sodium insertion into Li[Li0.2Mn1.8]O4 induces strain in the crystal lattice.}

An alternative cathode material, LiFePO(4), solves these problems, but has a kinetic problem involving strong electron/hole localization. One reason for this is believed to be the limited carrier density in the fixed monovalent Fe(3+)PO(4)/LiFe(2+)PO(4) two-phase electrode reaction in LixFePO4. Here, we provide experimental evidence that LixFePO4, at room temperature, can be described as a mixture of the Fe(3+)/Fe(2+) mixed-valent intermediate LialphaFePO4 and Li1-betaFePO4 phases. Using powder neutron diffraction, the site occupancy numbers for lithium in each phase were refined to be alpha=0.05 and 1-beta=0.89. The corresponding solid solution ranges outside the miscibility gap (0\textbackslash textlessx\textbackslash textlessalpha,1-beta\textbackslash textlessx\textbackslash textless1) were detected by the anomaly in the configurational entropy, and also by the deviation of the open-circuit voltage from the constant equilibrium potential. These findings encourage further improvement of this important class of compounds at ambient temperatures.},

The calculated deviations from experiments are separated into two parts: a systematic and uniform error related to the reference energy of O and the errors specific to diffferent oxidation states O2-, O2- 2 , and O- 2 .

Here, we review the recent demonstrations of soft X-ray spectroscopy for studying the interfaces and electrode materials. The focus of this review is on the recently developed mapping of resonant inelastic X-ray scattering (mRIXS) as a powerful probe of battery chemistry with superior sensitivity. Six different channels of soft X-ray absorption spectroscopy (sXAS) are introduced for different experimental purposes. Although conventional sXAS channels remain effective tools for quantitative analysis of the transition-metal states and surface chemistry, we elaborate the limitations of sXAS in both cationic and anionic redox studies. Particularly, based on experimental findings in various electrodes, we show that sXAS is unreliable for studying oxygen redox. We then demonstrate the mRIXS as a reliable technique for fingerprinting oxygen redox and summarize several crucial observations. We conclude that mRIXS is the tool-of-choice to study both the practical issue on reversibility of oxygen redox and the fundamental nature of bulk oxygen states. We hope this review clarifies the popular misunderstanding on oxygen sXAS results of oxide electrodes, and establishes a reliable technique for detecting oxygen redox through mRIXS.},

Lithium lanthanum zirconate (Li7La3Zr2O12, LLZO) with a garnet-type crystal structure is a promising solid Li+ conductor. We show that by incorporating only 5 wt \% of the ceramic filler comprising undoped, cubic-phase LLZO nanowires prepared by electrospinning, the room temperature ionic conductivity of a pmoalgynacitruydloenittorile1-.L3i1ClO\texttimes{} 4-1b0a-se4d composite is S/cm. Al-doped increased 3 orders of and Ta-doped LLZO nanowires are also synthesized and utilized as fillers, but the conductivity enhancement is similar as for the undoped LLZO nanowires. Solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) studies show that LLZO NWs partially modify the PAN polymer matrix and create preferential pathways for Li+ conduction through the modified polymer regions. CPEs with LLZO nanoparticles and Al2O3 nanowire fillers are also studied to elucidate the role of filler type (active vs passive), LLZO composition (undoped vs doped), and morphology (nanowire vs nanoparticle) on the CPE conductivity. It is demonstrated that both intrinsic Li+ conductivity and nanowire morphology are needed for optimal performance when using 5 wt \% of the ceramic filler in the CPE.},

We identified rich structural variety and chemical order/disorder including 3D atomic composition, grain boundaries, anti-phase boundaries, anti-site point defects and swap defects.

Here we report our investigations into a group of promising lithium doped sodium manganese oxide cathode materials with exceptionally high initial capacity of {$\sim$}223 mAh g-1 and excellent capacity retentions, attributed primarily to the absence of phase transformation in a wide potential range of electrochemical cycling, as confirmed by in-operando X-ray diffraction (XRD), Rietveld refinement, and high-resolution 7Li solid-state NMR characterizations.

Although the reversible discharge capacity decreases with increasing Cu amount, optimized composition such as LiCu0.25Ni0.25Mn1.5O4 exhibits high capacities at high rates.},

  abstract = {Predicting material properties of off-stoichiometry systems remains a long-standing and formidable challenge in rational materials design. A proper analysis of such systems by means of a supercell approach requires the exhaustive consideration of all possible superstructures, which can be a time-consuming process. On the contrary, the use of quasirandom approximants, although very computationally effective, implicitly bias the analysis toward disordered states with the lowest site correlations. Here, we propose a novel framework designed specifically to investigate stoichiometrically driven trends of disordered systems (i.e., having partial occupation and/or disorder in the atomic sites). At the heart of the approach is the identification and analysis of unique supercells of a virtually equivalent stoichiometry to the disordered material. We employ Boltzmann statistics to resolve system-wide properties at a high-throughput (HT) level. To maximize efficiency and accessibility, we integrated the method within the automatic HT computational framework AFLOW. As proof of concept, we apply our approach to three systems of interest, a zinc chalcogenide (ZnS 1-x Se x ), a wide-gap oxide semiconductor (Mg x Zn 1-x O), and an iron alloy (Fe 1-x Cu x ), at various stoichiometries. These systems exhibit properties that are highly tunable as a function of composition, characterized by optical bowing and linear ferromagnetic behavior. Not only are these qualities successfully predicted, but additional insight into underlying physical mechanisms is revealed.},

XRD, SEM, BET, Raman and FTIR and galvanostatic charge/discharge measurements were carried out to correlate their structure/morphology with their electrochemical characteristics. The experimental results reveal that both structure and morphology play important roles in the Li+ ion storage of LVO, which degrades in the sequential order from nanorods, to spheres, to flowers and finally to bulk. The LVO nanorods are hierarchical and have a small particle size, high specific surface area, and high crystallinity; thus, they exhibit the largest Li+ ion diffusion coefficient and best electrochemical performance among the four electrodes. Moreover, coating carbon on the single-crystal LVO nanorods further enhances their Li+ ion storage ability. Consequently, the carbon-coated LVO nanorods deliver a high reversible capacity of 440 mA h g-1 at 0.1 A g-1 with good cycling stability and demonstrate great practical application. In addition, the results promote a better fundamental understanding of the Li+ ion storage behavior in LVO and provide insight into the optimal design of LVO and other vanadium-based electrode materials.},

This new cathode material delivers high discharge capacities of 164 mA g-1 at 0.1 C and 68 mAh g-1 at a very high rate of 86 C, demonstrating an outstanding high rate capability.

  abstract = {Imperfections in organometal halide perovskite films such as grain boundaries (GBs), defects, and traps detrimentally cause significant nonradiative recombination energy loss and decreased power conversion efficiency (PCE) in solar cells. Here, a simple layer-by-layer fabrication process based on air exposure followed by thermal annealing is reported to grow perovskite films with large, single-crystal grains and vertically oriented GBs. The hole-transport medium Spiro-OMeTAD is then infiltrated into the GBs to form vertically aligned bulk heterojunctions. Due to the space-charge regions in the vicinity of GBs, the nonradiative recombination in GBs is significantly suppressed. The GBs become active carrier collection channels. Thus, the interal quantum efficiencies of the devices approach 100\% in the visible spectrum range. The optimized cells yield an average PCE of 16.3 {$\pm$} 0.9\%, comparable to the best solution-processed perovskite devices, establishing them as important alternatives to growing ideal single crystal thin films in the pursuit toward theoretical maximum PCE with industrially realistic processing techniques.},

Here we show that by defining a reliable and accessible descriptor \textasciicircum TI, which represents the topological robustness or feasibility of the candidate, and by searching the quantum materials repository aflowlib.org, we have automatically discovered 28 TIs (some of them already known) in five different symmetry families.

Herein, polymorphic heterostructures comprised of two indium oxide based photocatalysts, with distinct structures yet continuously adjustable fractions of the same composition, enable optimization of the activity and selectivity of CO2 hydrogenation to CO and CH3OH. The strategy rests on the cubic (c-) to rhombohedral (rh-) indium oxide hydroxide In2O3-x(OH)y phase transition, in which the fraction of the cubic phase that nucleates and grows within the rhombohedral phase is under precise structural and compositional control. Interfaces so-formed between cubic and rhombohedral polymorphs with distinct electronic band structures as well as separate locations of electron trapping oxygen vacancies and hole trapping hydroxyl defects in individual In2O3-x(OH)y components, enable charge generation, separation and lifetimes of photogenerated electron\textendash hole pairs to be finely tuned. This facilitates command over H2 and CO2 surface chemical reactions that are responsible for the activity and selectivity towards products CO and CH3OH. The control over the performance metrics of a CO2 hydrogenation photocatalyst provided by tuneable rh/c-In2O3-x(OH)y polymorphic heterostructures, affords promising opportunities for the future development of renewable synthetic fuels.},

  abstract = {In this paper, luminescence thermal quenching of M2SiO4:Eu2+ (M=Sr,Ba) orthosilicate phosphors and mechanisms for thermal quenching proposed by different authors are briefly reviewed. Depending on preparation conditions and/or Eu2+-doping concentrations, the quenching temperature (T1/2) and activation energy for thermal quenching of the same orthosilicate phosphor reported by different authors are inconsistent. The common conclusion is that T1/2 of the intermediate compound (Ba1\textendash -xSrx)2SiO4:Eu2+(x{$\approx$}0.5)is higher than that of either Sr2SiO4:Eu2+ or Ba2SiO4:Eu2+ end-member. Moreover, T1/2 of the best-performing SrBaSiO4:Eu2+ is evidently lower than that of YAG:Ce3+ and some Eu2+-doped nitride phosphors. Regarding the quenching mechanism, most of the investing ators attributed thermal quenching to a thermally assisted 4f-5d cross-over in the configuration coordinate diagram. Only a few authors ascribed thermal quenching to a thermally assisted photoionization of 5d electron to conduction band of the host. Nonetheless, a close inspection of T1/2 and Stokes shift derived from the vibrational spectra of the intermediate compound and end-member phosphors indicates that the 5d electron photoionization model instead of the 4f-5d crossing decay model should be the genuine mechanism for the thermal quenching of M2SiO4:Eu2+ (M=Sr,Ba) phosphors. Since the relationship between T1/2 and Stokes shift of the phosphors does not support the 4f-5d crossing decay model. The ionization probability of the 5d electron depends on the energy gap (EdC) between 5d1 level of the Eu2+ and conduction band minimum (CBM) of the host at higher temperatures. Lattice thermal expansion would result inan elevating 5d1 level of the Eu2+ along with a diminishing CBM of the hostandas a consequence are duction in EdC and an enhanced photoionization probability at elevated temperatures. Aless rigid lattice and hence a larger coefficient of thermal expansion of M2SiO4hosts should bethe physical origin of poorer thermal quenching properties of the orthosilicate phosphors.},

A new mechanism for synthesizing nanoscaled WC at ultralow temperature has been discovered. This discovery opens a novel route to synthesize valuable WC and other carbides at a cost-efficient way. The novel formation mechanism is based on an ion-exchange resin as carbon source to locally anchor the W and Fe species. As an intermediate, FeWO4 can be formed at lower temperature, which can be directly converted into WC along with the carbonization of resin. The size of WC can be less than 2 nm. The catalyst made with Pt nanoparticles supported on nanosized WC-GC (WC-graphitized carbon) shows enhanced electrocatalytic activity for oxygen reduction reaction. The result also indicates that the Pt nanoparticles deposited on WC-GC are dominated by Pt (111) plane and shows a mass activity of 257.7 mA mg(-1)Pt@0.9 V.},

Recently, chemical doping induced MIT in SmNiO               3               has been observed experimentally, with its resistivity changed by eight orders of magnitude. The mechanism of switching from one singly occupied Ni e               g               orbital to two singly occupied e               g               orbitals upon doping has been proposed by experimentalists and verified by computation. Here, we tested if this mechanism can be generally applied to other perovskite oxides with non-Ni B site elements. We applied first principles density functional theory (DFT) to study a series of perovskite oxides, CaFeO               3               , SrFeO               3               , BaFeO               3               and SmMnO               3               . We investigated the geometry and electronic structures of pure and hydrogen doped oxides. We found that pure CaFeO               3               , SrFeO               3               and BaFeO               3               are metallic while pure SmMnO               3               has a small band gap of 0.69 eV. Upon hydrogen doping, band gap opening was predicted for all four oxides: HSE06 predicted band gap values of 1.58 eV, 1.40 eV, 1.20 eV and 2.55 eV for H-doped CaFeO               3               , SrFeO               3               , BaFeO               3               and SmMnO               3               , respectively.

The probability density of Li cations has a minimum between the 2c and 4f or between the 2c and 2d positions on the diffusion path in contrast to the previous reports where the bottleneck has been thought to be located at the 2c, 2d, and 4f positions. On the basis of the present structural model, the Li-cation conductivity is discussed in terms of a two-dimensional bond-percolation model for Li-cation diffusion.

  abstract = {The orange-red emitting phosphors based on M 2 Si 5 N 8 :Eu (M = Sr, Ba) are widely utilized in white lightemitting diodes (WLEDs) because of their improvement of the color rendering index (CRI), which is brilliant for warm white light emission. Nitride-based phosphors are adopted in high-performance applications because of their excellent thermal and chemical stabilities. A series of nitridosilicate phosphor compounds, M 2-x Si 5 N 8 :Eu x (M = Sr, Ba), were prepared by solid-state reaction. The thermal degradation in air was only observed in Sr 2-x Si 5 N 8 :Eu x with x = 0.10, but it did not appear in Sr 2-x Si 5 N 8 :Eu x with x = 0.02 and Ba analogue with x = 0.10. This is an unprecedented investigation to study this phenomenon in the stable nitrides. The crystal structural variation upon heating treatment of these compounds was carried out using the in situ XRD measurements. The valence of Eu ions in these compounds was determined by electron spectroscopy for chemical analysis (ESCA) and X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) spectroscopy. The morphology of these materials was examined by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Combining all results, it is concluded that the origin of the thermal degradation in Sr 2-x Si 5 N 8 :Eu x with x = 0.10 is due to the formation of an amorphous layer on the surface of the nitride phosphor grain during oxidative heating treatment, which results in the oxidation of Eu ions from divalent to trivalent. This study provides a new perspective for the impact of the degradation problem as a consequence of heating processes in luminescent materials.},

More importantly, this universal GB energy model can be extrapolated to the energies of high {$\Sigma$} GBs without loss in accuracy. These results highlight the importance of capturing fundamental scaling physics and domain knowledge in the design of interpretable, extrapolatable machine learning models for ma\- terials science.},

A strong intraparticle segregation of Li is observed, and the degree of segregation is found to correlate with Li concentration. With increasing Li concentration, Li diffusivity and segregation are enhanced, and this behavior is tied to the structural response of the NPs with increasing lithiation. The atoms in the amorphous NPs undergo rearrangement in the regions of high Li concentration, introducing new pathways for Li transport and segregation. These localized atomic rearrangements, in turn, induce preferential crystallization near the surfaces of the NPs. Such rich, dynamical responses are not expected for crystalline NPs, where the presence of well-defined lattice sites leads to limited segregation and transport at high Li concentrations. The preferential crystallization in the near-surface region in amorphous NPs may offer enhanced stability and fast Li transport for Li-ion battery applications, in addition to having potentially useful properties for other materials science applications.},

However, they can also display a significant energetic driving force for chemical short-range ordering (SRO). Here, we investigate mechanisms underlying the mobilities of screw and edge dislocations in the body-centered cubic MoNbTaW RHEA over a wide temperature range using extensive molecular dynamics simulations based on a highly-accurate machine-learning interatomic potential. Further, we specifically evaluate how these mechanisms are affected by the presence of SRO. The mobility of edge dislocations is found to be enhanced by the presence of SRO, whereas the rate of double-kink nucleation in the motion of screw dislocations is reduced, although this influence of SRO appears to be attenuated at increasing temperature. Independent of the presence of SRO, a cross-slip locking mechanism is observed for the motion of screws, which provides for extra strengthening for refractory high-entropy alloy system.},

However, the hungry demand for vast energy sources in the modern society will conflict with the shortage of lithium resources on the earth. The first alternative choice may be sodium-related materials. Herein, we propose an electric energy storage system (sodium-ion capacitor) based on porous carbon and sodium titanate nanotubes (Na-TNT, Na(+)-insertion compounds) as positive and negative electrode materials, respectively, in conjunction with Na(+)-containing non-aqueous electrolytes. As a low-voltage (0.1-2 V) sodium insertion nanomaterial, Na-TNT was synthesized via a simple hydrothermal reaction. Compared with bulk sodium titanate, the predominance of Na-TNT is the excellent rate performance, which exactly caters to the need for electrochemical capacitors. The sodium-ion capacitors exhibited desirable energy density and power density (34 Wh kg(-1), 889 W kg(-1)). Furthermore, the sodium-ion capacitors had long cycling life (1000 cycles) and high coulombic efficiency ({$\approx$} 98 \% after the second cycle). More importantly, the conception of sodium-ion capacitor has been put forward.},

The studies reveal that the initial R3hm phase (O3) is maintained up to extraction of 0.70-0.75 Li and exhibits only  1\% change in volume over the range of composition. Additional extraction of Li results in the appearance of the O1 phase (trigonal; P3hm1), which displays a strong contraction in the c axis by 5.3\% and a volume decrease of 7.2\%. Oxygen vacancies were not evident in the completely delithiated material. Re-intercalation of lithium in this phase was relatively irreversible, however, resulting in poorly defined mixtures of the O3 and O1 structures that exhibited a large fraction of stacking faults. In contrast, materials that were not delithiated beyond x ) 0.30 resulted in fully reversible reformation of the original crystalline O3 phase on re-intercalation. Electrochemical cycling under different cutoff voltages were in accord with these observations and suggest an optimum upper cutoff voltage of 4.3-4.4 V.},

Ionic liquid (IL) electrolytes, which are inherently non-volatile and non-flammable, offer a safer alternative. Additionally, ILs offer the promise of enabling a rechargeable lithium metal electrode to deliver significant increases in energy. Amongst the various possible cation and anion combinations, ILs using the dicyanamide (DCA) anion, which contain no fluorine reducing cost, offer exceptionally low viscosities and high conductivities \textendash{} highly desirable characteristics for Li electrolyte solvents.

The influence of the chemical modification on their thermal properties, viscosity, ionic conductivity, ion association, and solvatochromic shifts was characterized and compared with the case of previously reported polycyano anions, N(CN)(2)(-) and C(CN)(3)(-). Among the 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium (BMI) salts, cyano-substituted (i.e., 1,1,2,3,3-pentacyanoallyl anion) salt has the highest melting point (42 degrees C), possibly indicating the importance of high local symmetry over decreased interionic CN...cation interactions due to the limited electron densities on terminal nitrogens of the anions, predicted by ab initio calculations. In the liquid state, methoxy-substituted (i.e., 2-methoxy-1,1,3,3-tetracyanoallyl anion) salt has the highest fluidity and ionic conductivity, associated with the significant conformational degree of freedom in the methoxy group. Although the ion diffusivity has no definite correlation with the Hammett parameter of the substituents, the introduction of electron-withdrawing cyano or cyanomethyl (i.e., 2-cyanomethyl-1,1,3,3-tetracyanoallyl anion) groups leads to the decrease in the degree of ion association and solvent donor ability, which were manifested in the Walden rule deviation and solvatochromic shift, respectively.},

  abstract = {The oxidative stability of glyme molecules is enhanced by the complex formation with alkali metal cations. Clear liquid can be obtained by simply mixing glyme (triglyme or tetraglyme) with lithium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)amide (Li[TFSA]) in a molar ratio of 1:1. The equimolar complex [Li(triglyme or tetraglyme)(1)][TFSA] maintains a stable liquid state over a wide temperature range and can be regarded as a room-temperature ionic liquid consisting of a [Li(glyme)(1)](+) complex cation and a [TFSA](-) anion, exhibiting high self-dissociativity (ionicity) at room temperature. The electrochemical oxidation of [Li(glyme)(1)][TFSA] takes place at the electrode potential of {$\sim$}5 V vs Li/Li(+), while the oxidation of solutions containing excess glyme molecules ([Li(glyme)(x)][TFSA], x \textbackslash textgreater 1) occurs at around 4 V vs Li/Li(+). This enhancement of oxidative stability is due to the donation of lone pairs of ether oxygen atoms to the Li(+) cation, resulting in the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy level lowering of a glyme molecule, which is confirmed by ab initio molecular orbital calculations. The solvation state of a Li(+) cation and ion conduction mechanism in the [Li(glyme)(x)][TFSA] solutions is elucidated by means of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and electrochemical methods. The experimental results strongly suggest that Li(+) cation conduction in the equimolar complex takes place by the migration of [Li(glyme)(1)](+) cations, whereas the ligand exchange mechanism is overlapped when interfacial electrochemical reactions of [Li(glyme)(1)](+) cations occur. The ligand exchange conduction mode is typically seen in a lithium battery with a configuration of [Li anode|[Li(glyme)(1)][TFSA]|LiCoO(2) cathode] when the discharge reaction of a LiCoO(2) cathode, that is, desolvation of [Li(glyme)(1)](+) and insertion of the resultant Li(+) into the cathode, occurs at the electrode-electrolyte interface. The battery can be operated for more than 200 charge-discharge cycles in the cell voltage range of 3.0-4.2 V, regardless of the use of ether-based electrolyte, because the ligand exchange rate is much faster than the electrode reaction rate.},

TM is typically characterized in terms of localized 2+ or 3+ charge in LiTMPO4 and TMPO4 structures, respectively, in which electron transport would take place by thermally activated hopping of metal-centered small polarons. We assess qualitative relationships between formal TM oxidation states and the static charges on TM and the dependence of small polaron stability on dp rehybridization. We propose an empirical correlation between the ratio of cationic/anionic charge differences (dQTM/dQO) for lithiated and delithiated end members and the relative degree of electron localization on the cationic versus anionic sublattices. Large values of dQTM relative to dQO or a dQTM/dQO value greater than 2 appears consistent with phases that would tend toward stable small polaron formation at TM sites, such as mixed 2+/3+-like oxidation states. If the ratio of dQTM/dQO is smaller than 2 and the magnitudes of the charge differences are small, the system tends to behave more itinerant-like.},

In general, the group IVB carbides have a higher vacancy migration energy than that of the group VB carbides which could explain the difficulty in experimentally forming such vacancy-ordered phases. In addition, the group IVB carbides do not have a stable intrinsic stacking fault (ISF), which is present in the group VB carbides. This ISF is used to rationalize the absence of such faulted phases in the group IVB carbides but their presence in the group VB carbides.},

Kinetic Monte Carlo simulations are used, parametrized by molecular-dynamics-based predictions of activation energy barriers for Li+ and e- diffusion. Simulations reveal the central role of electrostatic coupling between Li+ and e- on their collective drift diffusion at the nanoscale. They also demonstrate that a high contact area between the conductive matrix and rutile nanoparticles leads to undesirable coupling-induced surface saturation effects during Li+ insertion, which limits the overall capacity and conductivity of the material. These results help provide guidelines for design of nanostructured electrode materials with improved electrochemical performance.},

However, given that solute atoms interact weakly with the elastic fields of screw dislocations, it has long been accepted that solution hardening is only marginally effective in materials with mobile screw dislocations. By using transmission electron microscopy and nanomechanical characterization, we report that the intense hardening effect of dilute oxygen solutes in pure a-Ti is due to the interaction between oxygen and the core of screw dislocations that mainly glide on prismatic planes. First-principles calculations reveal that distortion of the interstitial sites at the screw dislocation core creates a very strong but short-range repulsion for oxygen that is consistent with experimental observations. These results establish a highly effective mechanism for strengthening by interstitial solutes.}

The generalized stacking fault surfaces for all of the materials were computed and used to provide a more comprehensive understanding of slip plane choices. Through analysis of this data, it is found that among different indicators of slip, the normalized splitting width and the intrinsic stacking fault energy are the most useful indicators of the choice of slip planes in these materials.

A generic feature of considered random-walk processes is an effect of velocity echo identified by the existence of time-dependent regions where most of the walkers are moving in the direction opposite to their initial motion.

For example, the related processes of dendritic deposition of lithium metal and the formation of solid\textendash electrolyte interphase layers6,7 are known to be key determinants of battery safety and performance in high-energy-density lithium-metal batteries. But exactly what is involved in these two processes, which occur at a solid\textendash liquid interface, has long been debated8\textendash 11 because of the challenges of observing such interfaces directly. Here we adapt a technique that has enabled cryo-transmission electron microscopy (cryo-TEM) of hydrated specimens in biology\textemdash immobilization of liquids by rapid freezing, that is, vitrification12. By vitrifying the liquid electrolyte we preserve it and the structures at solid\textendash liquid interfaces in lithium-metal batteries in their native state, and thus enable structural and chemical mapping of these interfaces by cryo-scanning transmission electron microscopy (cryo-STEM). We identify two dendrite types coexisting on the lithium anode, each with distinct structure and composition. One family of dendrites has an extended solid\textendash electrolyte interphase layer, whereas the other unexpectedly consists of lithium hydride instead of lithium metal and may contribute disproportionately to loss of battery capacity. The insights into the formation of lithium dendrites that our work provides demonstrate the potential of cryogenic electron microscopy for probing nanoscale processes at intact solid\textendash liquid interfaces in functional devices such as rechargeable batteries.},

Machine learning algorithms and chemoinformatics can potentially accelerate this process by recognizing otherwise inscrutable patterns in large datasets. Herein we report a computationally guided workflow for chiral catalyst selection using chemoinformatics at every stage of development. Robust molecular descriptors that are agnostic to the catalyst scaffold allow for selection of a universal training set on the basis of steric and electronic properties. This set can be used to train machine learning methods to make highly accurate predictive models over a broad range of selectivity space. Using support vector machines and deep feed-forward neural networks, we demonstrate accurate predictive modeling in the chiral phosphoric acid\textendash catalyzed thiol addition to N -acylimines.},

Understanding of phonon transport in bulk materials has advanced significantly as the firstprinciples calculations are applied to thermoelectric materials, and experimental tools are being developed. Some new strategies have been developed to improve electron transport in thermoelectric materials. Fundamental questions on phonon and electron transport across interfaces and in thermoelectric materials remain. With thermoelectric materials reaching high ZT values well above one, the field is ready to take a step forward and go beyond the materials' figure of merit. Developing device contacts and module fabrication techniques, developing a platform for efficiency measurements, and identifying applications are becoming increasingly important for the future of thermoelectrics.}

With decreasing tension along the axis of the nanostructure we find a series of transitions first from a straight to a zigzag wire, then to planar triangular or hexagonal stripes and further to a nanorod consisting of a periodic stacking of distorted octahedra. At local equilibrium all nanostructures are in a high-moment state, with absolute values of the local magnetic moments per atom varying between 3.79 3.54 B for a triangular collinear antiferromagnetic stripe, 3.40 stripe, and 2.96 B for a straight noncollinear antiferromagnetic Mn monowire, B for a hexagonal collinear ferrimagnetic B for an octahedral noncollinear ferrimagnetic nanorod. For all low-dimensional nanostruc- tures except the monowire we find collinear and noncollinear magnetic structures to be energetically nearly degenerate, if the geometric and magnetic degrees of freedom are relaxed simultaneously. The energetic consequences of a modest change in the interatomic distances are comparable to those of a large canting of the magnetic moments. Compression of the nanostructures leads to a decrease in the magnetic moments.}

The perovskite oxide candidates for CO2 photoreduction are primarily nanostructured forms of titanates, niobates, tantalates and cobaltates. These materials form the focus of this review article because they are much sought-after due to their nontoxic nature, adequate chemical stability, and tunable crystal structures, bandgaps and surface energies. As compared to conventional semiconductors and nanomaterial catalysts, nanostructured perovskite oxides also exhibit an extended optical-absorption edge, longer charge carrier lifetimes, and favorable band-alignment with respect to reduction potential of activated CO2 and reduction products of the same. While CO2 reduction product yields of several hundred {$\mu$}mol-1 h-1 are observed with many types of perovskite oxide nanomaterials in stand-alone forms, yield of such quantities are not common with semiconductor nanomaterials of other types. In this review, we present current state-of-the-art synthesis methods to form perovskite oxide nanomaterials, and procedures to engineer their bandgaps. This review also presents a comprehensive summary and discussion on crystal structures, defect distribution, morphologies and electronic properties of the perovskite oxides, and correlation of these properties to CO2 photoreduction performance. This review offers researchers key insights for developing advanced perovskite oxides in order to further improve the yields of CO2 reduction products.},

We also report how accurately the HOMO-LUMO gaps of these methods predict the lowest excitation energies using both time-independent and time-dependent DFT (TD-DFT). The 11 DFT functionals include the local spin density approximation (LSDA), five generalized gradient approximation (GGA) functionals, three hybrid GGA functionals, one hybrid functional, and one hybrid meta GGA functional. We find that the HOMO eigenvalues predicted by KMLYP, BH\$\textbackslash backslash\$\&HLYP, B3LYP, PW91, PBE, and BLYP predict the -IPs with average absolute errors of 0.73, 1.48, 3.10, 4.27, 4.33, and 4.41 eV, respectively. The LUMOs of all functionals fail to accurately predict the EAs. Although the GGA functionals inaccurately predict both the HOMO and LUMO eigenvalues, they predict the HOMO-LUMO gap relatively accurately (similar to 0.73 eV). On the other hand, the LUMO eigenvalues of the hybrid functionals fail to predict the EA to the extent that they include HF exchange, although increasing HF exchange improves the correspondence between the HOMO eigenvalue and -IP so that the HOMO-LUMO gaps are inaccurately predicted by hybrid DFT functionals. We find that TD-DFT with all functionals accurately predicts the HOMO-LUMO gaps. A linear correlation between the calculated HOMO eigenvalue and the experimental -IP and calculated HOMO-LUMO gap and experimental lowest excitation energy enables us to derive a simple correction formula.},

  abstract = {Thereduction potentials of five organic carbonates commonly employed in lithiumbattery electrolytes, ethylene carbonate (EC), propylene carbonate (PC), diethyl carbonate(DEC), dimethyl carbonate (DMC), and vinylene carbonate (VC) were determinedby cyclic voltammetry using inert (Au or glassy carbon) electrodesin tetrahydrofuran/LiClO4 supporting electrolyte. The reduction potentials for all fiveorganic carbonates were above 1 V (vs. Li/Li + ). PC reductionwas observed to have a significant kinetic hindrance. The measuredreduction potentials for EC, DEC, and PC were consistent withthermodynamic values calculated using density functional theory (DFT) assuming one-electronreduction to the radical anion. The experimental values for VCand DMC were, however, much more positive than the calculatedvalues, which we attribute to different reaction pathways. The roleof VC as an additive in a PC-based electrolyte wasinvestigated using conventional constant-current cycling combined with ex situ infraredspectroscopy and in situ atomic force microscopy (AFM). We confirmedstable cycling of a commercial li-ion battery carbon anode ina PC-based electrolyte with 5 mol \% VC added. Thepreferential reduction of VC and the solid electrolyte interphase layerformation therefrom appears to inhibit PC cointercalation and subsequent graphiteexfoliation. \textcopyright 2001 The Electrochemical Society.

Examples of two-phase combinations on different length scales will be discussed with a focus on the hot carrier filtering effect that results from the selective scattering of carriers with different energies. On the basis of this strategy, heterostructures fabricated by both the bottom-up solution approaches at low temperature and top-down solid-state deposition routes that show promise in improving the thermoelectric figure of merit are highlighted.},

Focusing on the A2BX4 metal-chalcogenide group with Aand B atoms being either main group elements or only one of them being a 3d transition metal, a total of 255 are reported, whereas 429 chemically reasonable A2BX4 are unreported.We have applied first-principles thermodynamics based on density functional methodology, predicting that about 100 of the 429 unreported A2BX4 metal-chalcogenides are likely to be stable. These include 14 oxides, 34 sulfides, 28 selenides, and 24 tellurides that are predicted here to be energetically stable with respect to decomposition into any combination of elemental, binary, and ternary competing phases. We provide the lowest-energy crystal structures of the predicted A2BX4 compounds, as well as the next few energetically higher metastable structures. Such predictions are carried out via direct first-principles calculations of candidate structure types and confirmed for a few compounds using the global space-group optimization (GSGO) search method. In some cases, uncommon oxidation states and/or coordination environments are found for elements in the stable A2BX4 compounds predicted here. We estimated the growth conditions in terms of temperature and partial pressure of the reactants from extensive thermodynamic stability analysis, and found dozens of compounds that might be grown at normal synthesis conditions. Attempts at synthesis of the stable A2BX4 compounds predicted here are called for.},

In the method, the liquid phase of ionic liquid is explicitly sampled using classical MD. The electrochemical window, estimated by the energy difference between the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO), is calculated at the density functional theory (DFT) level based on snapshots obtained from classical MD trajectories. The snapshots were relaxed using AIMD and quenched to their local energy minima, which assures that the HOMO/LUMO calculations are based on stable configurations on the same potential energy surface. The new procedure was applied to a group of ionic liquids for which the ECWs were also experimentally measured in a self-consistent manner. It was found that the predicted ECWs not only agree with the experimental trend very well but also the values are quantitatively accurate. The proposed method provides an efficient way to compare ECWs of ionic liquids in the same context, which has been difficult in experiments or simulation due to the fact that ECW values sensitively depend on experimental setup and conditions.},

Our results suggest that the primary driving force for the Na ordering is the screened Coulomb interaction among Na ions. Possible effects of the Na ordering on the electronic structure of the CoO2 layer are discussed. We propose that the nonexistence of a charge ordered insulating state at x=2/3 is due to the lack of a commensurate Na ordering pattern, whereas an extremely stable Na ordering at x=0.5 enhances the charge ordering tendency, resulting in an insulating state as observed experimentally.},

Supercapacitors do not suffer from this problem, but are restricted to much lower stored energy per mass (energy density) than batteries. A storage technology that combines the rate performance of supercapacitors with the energy density of batteries would significantly advance portable and distributed power technology. Here, we demonstrate very large battery charge and discharge rates with minimal capacity loss by using cathodes made from a self-assembled three-dimensional bicontinuous nanoarchitecture consisting of an electrolytically active material sandwiched between rapid ion and electron transport pathways. Rates of up to 400C and 1,000C for lithium-ion and nickel-metal hydride chemistries, respectively, are achieved (where a 1C rate represents a one-hour complete charge or discharge), enabling fabrication of a lithium-ion battery that can be 90\% charged in 2 minutes.},

  abstract = {Advanced electrical energy storage technology is a game changer for a clean, sustainable, and secure energy future because efficient utilization of newable energy hinges on cost-effect and efficient energy storage. Further, the viability of many emerging technologies depends on breakthroughs in energy storage technologies, including electric vehicles (EVs) or hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs) and smart grids. Lithium-ion batteries (LIBs), a great success in the portable electronics sector, are believed also the most promising power sources for emerging technologies such as EVs and smart grids. To date, however, the existing LIBs (with LiCoOx cathode and graphite anode) are still unable to meet the strict requirements for safety, cycling stability, and rate capability. The development of advanced anode materials, which can overcome the shortcomings of graphite anode (such as formation of dendritic lithium during charge and undesirable solid electrolyte interface), is of critical importance to enhancing the cycling stability and operational safety of LIBs. Lithium titanate (Li4Ti5O12) has recently attracted considerable attentions as a potential anode material of LIBs for high power applications due to several outstanding features, including a flat charge/discharge plateaus (around 1.55V vs. Li/Li+) because of the two-phase lithium insertion/extraction mechanism and minimum chance for the formation of SEI and dendritic lithium, dramatically enhance the potential for high rate capability and safety. In addition, there is almost no volume change during the lithium insertion and extraction processes, ensuring a high cycling stability and long operational life. However, the electronic conductivity of Li4Ti5O12 is relatively low, resulting in large polarization lose, more so at higher cycling rates, and poor rate performance. Currently, considerable research efforts have been devoted to improving the performance of Li4Ti5O12 at fast charge/discharge rates, and some important progresses have been made. In this review, we first present a general overview of the structural features, thermodynamic properties, transport properties, and the electrochemical behavior of Li4Ti5O12 under typical battery operating conditions. We then provide a comprehensive review of the recent advancements made in characterization, modification, and applications of Li4Ti5O12 electrodes to LIBs, including nanostructuring, surface coating, morphological optimization, doping, and rational design of composite electrodes. Finally, we highlight the critical challenges facing us today and future perspectives for further development of Li4Ti5O12-based electrodes. It is hoped that this review may provide some useful guidelines for rational design of better electrodes for advanced LIBs.},

We evaluate the zero-temperature spin stiffness D(0) and the Curie temperature TC on the basis of the double exchange model using the measured values of the bare bandwidth W and the Hund's rule coupling JH. The calculated D(0) and TC values are too small compared with the observed ones even without considering a strong electron-phonon coupling. We thus suggest that the ferromagnetism in doped manganites should not originate from the double exchange interaction. On the other hand, an alternative model based on the d-p exchange and a strong electron-phonon coupling can quantitatively explain the magnetoresistance and TC values.},

Such behavior is consistent with small-polaron coherent motion which involves a relaxation due to a soft optical phonon mode that is strongly coupled to the carriers.

  abstract = {Piecewise linearity of the energy with respect to fractional electron removal or addition is a requirement of an electronic structure method that necessitates the presence of a derivative discontinuity at integer electron occupation. Semi-local exchange-correlation (xc) approximations within density functional theory (DFT) fail to reproduce this behavior, giving rise to deviations from linearity with a convex global curvature that is evidence of many-electron, self-interaction error and electron delocalization. Popular functional tuning strategies focus on reproducing piecewise linearity, especially to improve predictions of optical properties. In a divergent approach, Hubbard U-augmented DFT (i.e., DFT+U) treats self-interaction errors by reducing the local curvature of the energy with respect to electron removal or addition from one localized subshell to the surrounding system. Although it has been suggested that DFT+U should simultaneously alleviate global and local curvature in the atomic limit, no detailed study on real systems has been carried out to probe the validity of this statement. In this work, we show when DFT+U should minimize deviations from linearity and demonstrate that a ``+U'' correction will never worsen the deviation from linearity of the underlying xc approximation. However, we explain varying degrees of efficiency of the approach over 27 octahedral transition metal complexes with respect to transition metal (Sc\textendash Cu) and ligand strength (CO, NH3, and H2O) and investigate select pathological cases where the delocalization error is invisible to DFT+U within an atomic projection framework. Finally, we demonstrate that the global and local curvatures represent different quantities that show opposing behavior with increasing ligand field strength, and we identify where these two may still coincide.},

Perovskite solar cells constructed with a variety of configurations have demonstrated unprecedented progress in efficiency, reaching about 20\% from multiple groups after only several years of active research. A key to this success is the development of various solution-synthesis and film-deposition techniques for controlling the morphology and composition of hybrid perovskites. The rapid progress in material synthesis and device fabrication has also promoted the development of other optoelectronic applications including light-emitting diodes, photodetectors, and transistors. Both experimental and theoretical investigations on organic\textendash inorganic hybrid perovskites have enabled some critical fundamental understandings of this material system. Recent studies have also demonstrated progress in addressing the potential stability issue, which has been identified as a main challenge for future research on halide perovskites. Here, we review recent progress on hybrid perovskites including basic chemical and crystal structures, chemical synthesis of bulk/nanocrystals and thin films with their chemical and physical properties, device configurations, operation principles for various optoelectronic applications (with a focus on solar cells), and photophysics of charge-carrier dynamics.

Analysis of XAS relies on comparison of measured spectra to reliable reference spectra.

In this work, we report the development of XASdb, a large database of computed reference XAS, and an Ensemble-Learned Spectra IdEntification (ELSIE) algorithm for the matching of spectra. XASdb currently hosts more than 800,000 K-edge X-ray absorption near-edge spectra (XANES) for over 40,000 materials from the open-science Materials Project database. We discuss a high-throughput automation framework for FEFF calculations, built on robust, rigorously benchmarked parameters. FEFF is a computer program uses a real-space Green's function approach to calculate X-ray absorption spectra. We will demonstrate that the ELSIE algorithm, which combines 33 weak ``learners'' comprising a set of preprocessing steps and a similarity metric, can achieve up to 84.2\% accuracy in identifying the correct oxidation state and coordination environment of a test set of 19 K-edge XANES spectra encompassing a diverse range of chemistries and crystal structures. The XASdb with the ELSIE algorithm has been integrated into a web application in the Materials Project, providing an important new public resource for the analysis of XAS to all materials researchers. Finally, the ELSIE algorithm itself has been made available as part of veidt, an open source machine-learning library for materials science.},

The DFT predicted 0K stability diagrams indicate that Co-Mn mixing reduces the energetic differences between Na orderings, which may account for the reduction of the number of phase transformations observed during cycling of mixed TM P2 layered oxides compared to single TM. Using ab initio molecular dynamics simulations and nudged elastic band calculations, we show that the TM composition at the Na(1) (face-sharing) site has a strong influence on the Na site energies, which in turns impacts the kinetics of Na diffusion towards the end of charge. By employing a site percolation model, we establish theoretical upper and lower bounds for TM concentration based on their effect on Na(1) site energies, providing a framework to rationally tune mixed TM compositions for optimal Na diffusion.},

  abstract = {Organic-inorganic hybrid solid electrolytes are expected to integrate the merits of both moieties for addressing the challenges in achieving fast ion conduction and high stability for energy storage applications. Li10GeP2S12 (LGPS)-poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) (bis(trifluoromethane)sulfonimide lithium (LiTFSI)) hybrid electrolytes have been prepared, which exhibit ionic conductivities up to 0.22 mS cm-1 and good longterm cycling stability against Li-metal. High-resolution solid-state 6Li NMR is employed to examine the local structural environments of Li ions in the LGPS-PEO (LiTFSI) hybrids, which identifies Li ions from PEO (LiTFSI), in bulk LGPS, and at LGPS-PEO interfaces. Tracer-exchange Li NMR reveals that Li ions transport mainly through LGPS-PEO interfaces. The impact of LGPS and LiTFSI contents on the interface chemistry within LGPS-PEO hybrid electrolytes has been examined. The measured conductivities of LGPS-PEO hybrids positively correlate with the available Li ions at LGPS-PEO interfaces. This study provides insights for engineering interfaces in organic- inorganic hybrids to develop high-performance electrolytes for solid-state rechargeable batteries.},

Here, we investigate the role of chemical short-range ordering (CSRO) on dislocation glide in two model RMPEAs - TaNbTi and MoNbTi - using a multi-scale modeling approach. A highly accurate machine learning interatomic potential was developed for the Mo-Ta-Nb-Ti system and used to demonstrate that MoNbTi exhibits a much greater degree of SRO than TaNbTi and the local composition has a direct effect on the unstable stacking fault energies (USFE). From mesoscale phase-field dislocation dynamics simulations, we find that increasing SRO leads to higher mean USFEs, thereby increasing the stress required for dislocation glide. The gliding dislocations experience significant hardening due to pinning and depinning caused by random compositional fluctuations, with higher SRO decreasing the degree of USFE dispersion and hence, amount of hardening. Finally, we show how the morphology of an expanding dislocation loop is affected by the applied stress, with higher SRO requiring higher applied stresses to achieve smooth screw dislocation glide.},

  abstract = {Composite electrolytes are widely studied for their potential in realizing improved ionic conductivity and electrochemical stability. Understanding the complex mechanisms of ion transport within composites is critical for effectively designing high-performance solid electrolytes. This study examines the compositional dependence of the three determining factors for ionic conductivity, including ion mobility, ion transport pathways, and active ion concentration. The results show that with increase in the fraction of ceramic Li7La3Zr2O12 (LLZO) phase in the LLZO-poly(ethylene oxide) composites, ion mobility decreases, ion transport pathways transit from polymer to ceramic routes, and the active ion concentration increases. These changes in ion mobility, transport pathways, and concentration collectively explain the observed trend of ionic conductivity in composite electrolytes. Liquid additives alter ion transport pathways and increase ion mobility, thus enhancing ionic conductivity significantly. It is also found that a higher content of LLZO leads to improved electrochemical stability of composite electrolytes. This study provides insight into the recurring observations of compositional dependence of ionic conductivity in current composite electrolytes and pinpoints the intrinsic limitations of composite electrolytes in achieving fast ion conduction.},

In a departure from prior works, the coordination environment is described as a distribution over 25 distinct coordination motifs with coordination numbers ranging from 1 to 12. More importantly, we show that the random forest models can be used to predict coordination environments from experimental K-edge XANES with minimal loss in accuracy.

However, its application at lower temperatures is limited by oxygen embrittlement, a phenomenon known as ``pesting''. In this work, we comprehensively investigate the role of Zr in mitigating pesting in MoSi2 using density functional theory calculations. We show that Zr dopants reduce the embrittling effects of oxygen interstitials at MoSi2 grain boundaries by being a charge donor to oxygen. However, a more substantial effect is observed when Zr is present as a secondary getter nanoparticle phase. Oxygen interstitials have a strong thermodynamic driving force to migrate the Zr subsurface at the Zr/MoSi2 interface, and the work of separation of the clean and oxygen-contaminated Zr/MoSi2 interfaces are much higher than that of MoSi2 grain boundaries. Finally, we present an efficient screening approach to identify other potential getter elements using simple thermodynamic descriptors, which can be extended to other alloy systems of interest. These findings provide crucial fundamental insights and further avenues to optimize Mo and other alloys.},

First, we screened all bulk materials in the database of Materials Project for layered structures by a topology-based algorithm and theoretically exfoliated them into monolayers. Then, we generated new 2D materials by chemical substitution of elements in known 2D materials by others from the same group in the periodic table. The structural, electronic and energetic properties of these 2D materials are consistently calculated, to provide a starting point for further material screening, data mining, data analysis and artificial intelligence applications.

The theory combines continuum linear elasticity theory with density functional theory to analyze epitaxial growth in this system. It is demonstrated that if one accounts for interfacial energies and strains, the presence of misfit dislocations, and the compliance of the MoS2 substrate, the experimentally observed growth orientation is favored despite the fact that it represents a larger elastic mismatch than two competing structures. The stability of the experimentally preferred orientation is attributed to the formation of a large number of strong Au-S bonds, and it is noted that this strong bond may serve as a means to exfoliate and transfer large single layers sheets of MoS2, as well as to engineer strain within single layers of MoS2. The potential for using a van der Waals-bonded layered material as a compliant substrate for applications in 2D electronic devices and epitaxial thin film growth is discussed.}

The number of valence electrons of transition metals or the valence electron concentration (VEC) of TMB2has strong effects on the lattice parameters, stability and mechanical properties of TMB2. Both lattice constants a and c decrease with VEC, but c decreases faster than a, which is attributed to the enhanced TM d-B p (sp2) bonding.

  abstract = {Advancing perovskite solar cell technologies toward their theoretical power conversion efficiency (PCE) requires delicate control over the carrier dynamics throughout the entire device. By controlling the formation of the perovskite layer and careful choices of other materials, we suppressed carrier recombination in the absorber, facilitated carrier injection into the carrier transport layers, and maintained good carrier extraction at the electrodes. When measured via reverse bias scan, cell PCE is typically boosted to 16.6\% on average, with the highest efficiency of {$\sim$}19.3\% in a planar geometry without antireflective coating. The fabrication of our perovskite solar cells was conducted in air and from solution at low temperatures, which should simplify manufacturing of large-area perovskite devices that are inexpensive and perform at high levels.},

  abstract = {Exciting advances have been made in artificial intelligence (AI) during recent decades. Among them, applications of machine learning (ML) and deep learning techniques brought human-competitive performances in various tasks of fields, including image recognition, speech recognition, and natural language understanding. Even in Go, the ancient game of profound com-plexity, the AI player has already beat human world champions convincingly with and without learning from the human. In this work, we show that our unsupervised machines (Atom2Vec) can learn the basic properties of atoms by themselves from the exten-sive database of known compounds and materials. These learned properties are represented in terms of high-dimensional vectors, and clustering of atoms in vector space classifies them into mean-ingful groups consistent with human knowledge. We use the atom vectors as basic input units for neural networks and other ML models designed and trained to predict materials properties, which demonstrate significant accuracy. atomism | machine learning | materials discovery T he past 20 y witnessed the accumulation of an unprecedent-edly massive amount of data in materials science via both experimental explorations and numerical simulations (1\textendash 5). The huge datasets not only enable but also call for data-based sta-tistical approaches. As a result, a new paradigm has emerged which aims to harness artificial intelligence (AI) and machine-learning (ML) techniques (6\textendash 10) to assist materials research and discovery. Several initial attempts have been made along this path (11\textendash 16). Most of them learned maps from materi-als information (input) to materials properties (output) based on known materials samples. The input or feature of materials involves descriptors of constituents: Certain physical or chem-ical attributes of atoms are taken, depending on the materials property under prediction (11, 14, 17). Despite the success so far, these works heavily rely on researchers' wise selection of relevant descriptors; thus the degree of intelligence is still very limited from a theoretical perspective. And practically, extra computations are usually unavoidable for machines to interpret such atom descriptors which are in the form of abstract human knowledge. To create a higher level of AI and to overcome the practi-cal limitation, we propose Atom2Vec in this paper, which lets machines learn their own knowledge about atoms from data. Atom2Vec considers only existence of compounds in a materials database, without reference to any specific property of materials. This massive dataset is leveraged for a learning feature in mate-rials science in an unsupervised manner (18\textendash 23). Because of the absence of materials property labels, Atom2Vec is naturally pre-vented from being biased to one certain aspect. As a result, the learned knowledge can yield complete and universal descriptions of atoms in principle, as long as the dataset is sufficiently large and representative. Atom2Vec follows the core idea that prop-erties of an atom can be inferred from the environments it lives in, which is similar to the distributional hypothesis in linguistics (24). In a compound, each atom can be selected as a target type, while the environment refers to all remaining atoms together with their positions relative to the target atom. Intuitively, similar atoms tend to appear in similar environments, which allows our Atom2Vec to extract knowledge from the associations between atoms and environments and then represent it in a vector form as discussed in the following.},

To shed further light on this issue we have studied various magnetic structures of enlarged double cells. The calculation is carried out self-consistently within the unrestricted Hartree-Fock approximation and the real-space recursion method. Our results show that the magnetic ground state mainly depends on the competition between the crystal field strength Dq and Hund's coupling j. For a fixed j, it can be either the intermediate-spin state (t2g 4 eg 1 ), the low-spin\textendash intermediate-spin ferromagnetically and charge-ordered state (t2g 5 eg 0 -t2g 4 eg 1 -FM!, or the low-spin state (t2g 5 eg 0 ) as Dq increases. However, the intermediate-spin state is the most probable candidate for the magnetic ground state in view of the experimental photoemission spectra and magnetic moment.},

Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) offers extremely high spatial resolution (less than one a\r{}ngstro\textasciidieresis m) and the ability to provide systematic information from both real and reciprocal space. However, very few TEM studies1\textendash 3 have been carried out on surfaces because the information from the bulk dominates the very weak signals originating from surfaces. Here we report an experimental approach to extract surface information effectively from a thickness series of electron energy-loss spectra containing different weights of surface signals, using a wedge-shaped sample. Using the (001) surface of the technologically important compound strontium titanate, SrTiO3 (refs 4\textendash 6), as a model system for validation, our method shows that surface spectra are sensitive to the atomic reconstruction and indicate bonding and crystal-field changes surrounding the surface Ti cations. Very good agreement can be achieved between the experimental surface spectra and crystal-field multiplet calculations based on the proposed atomic surface structure optimized by density functional calculations3. The distorted TiO62x units indicated by the proposedmodel can be viewed directly in our high-resolution scanning TEM images. We suggest that this approach be used as a general method to extract valuable spectroscopic information from surface atoms in parallel with high-resolution images in TEM.},

Among the known sodium superionic conductors, the Na3PnS4 family and the recently discovered Na11Sn2PnS12 (Pn = P, Sb) have garnered major interest due to their extremely high ionic conductivities. In this work, comprehensive investigation of the Na3PnS4-Na4TtS4 (Pn = P/As/Sb, Tt = Si/Ge/Sn) phase space of superionic conductors using density functional theory calculations, as well as AIMD simulations on the promising new Na11Sn2PnS12 (Pn=P/As/Sb) structures are presented. Crucial design rules on the effect of cation mixing are extracted on relative phase stability, electrochemical stability, moisture stability, and ionic conductivity. In particular, it is shown that while larger cations can substantially improve the ionic conductivity and moisture stability in these structures, there is an inherent trade-off in terms of electrochemical stability. Na11Sn2AsS12 is also identified as a hitherto unexplored stable sodium superionic conductor with higher Na+ conductivity and better moisture stability than the Na11Sn2PS12 and Na11Sn2SbS12 phases already reported experimentally.},

With further variation of surface unit cells, we study the reconstructions of the polar surface MgO (111). Experiment has detected an oxygen trimer (ozone) motif [ Plass et al. Phys. Rev.

Finally, we perform a variable stoichiometry search for a complex ternary system: semipolar GaN (10{$\overline 1$} 1) with and without adsorbed oxygen. The search yields a counterintuitive reconstruction based on N3 trimers. These examples demonstrate that an automated scheme to explore the energy landscape of surfaces will improve our understanding of surface reconstructions.

In this study, we performed first principles calculations to evaluate the thermodynamics of the interfaces between solid electrolyte and electrode materials and to identify the chemical and electrochemical stabilities of these interfaces.

Currently, it remains a challenge to synthesize these phosphors with high photoluminescence quantum yields through a convenient chemical route. Herein we propose a general but convenient strategy based on efficient cation exchange reaction, which had been originally regarded only effective in synthesizing nano-sized materials before, for the synthesis of Mn(4+)-activated fluoride microcrystals such as K2TiF6, K2SiF6, NaGdF4 and NaYF4. Particularly we achieve a photoluminescence quantum yield as high as 98\% for K2TiF6:Mn(4+). By employing it as red phosphor, we fabricate a high-performance white LED with low correlated colour temperature (3,556 K), high-colour-rendering index (Ra=81) and luminous efficacy of 116 lm W(-1). These findings show great promise of K2TiF6:Mn(4+) as a commercial red phosphor in warm white LEDs, and open up new avenues for the exploration of novel non-rare-earth red emitting phosphors.},

  abstract = {We report two novel, earth-abundant lithium superionic conductors, Li3Y(PS4)2 and Li5PS4Cl2, that are predicted to satisfy the necessary combination of good phase stability, high Li+ conductivity, wide band gap and good electrochemical stability for solid electrolyte applications in all-solid-state rechargeable lithium-ion batteries. These candidates were identified from a high-throughput first principles screening of the Li-P- S ternary and Li-M-P-S (where M is a non-redox-active element) quaternary chemical spaces, including candidates obtained by replacing Ag with Li in the Ag-P-S and Ag-M-P-S chemical spaces. An efficient tiered screening strategy was developed that combines topological analysis with ab initio molecular dynamics simulations to rapidly exclude candidates unlikely to satisfy the stringent conductivity requirements of lithium superionic conductors. In particular, we find Li3Y(PS4)2 to be an extremely promising candidate exhibiting a room-temperature Li+ conductivity of 2.16 mS/cm, which can be increased multi-fold to 7.14 mS/cm and 5.25 mS/cm via aliovalent doping with Ca2+ and Zr4+, respectively. More critically, we show that the phase and electrochemical stability of Li3Y(PS4)2 is expected to be better than current state-of-the-art lithium superionic conductors.},

We show that pristine c-Na3PS4 is an extremely poor Na ionic conductor, and the introduction of Na + excess is the key to achieving reasonable Na + conductivities. We studied the effect of aliovalent doping of M4+ for P5+ in c-Na3PS4, yielding Na3+xMxP1-xS4 (M = Si, Ge, and Sn with x = 0.0625; M = Si with x = 0.125). The formation energies in all the doped structures with dopant concentration of x = 0.0625 are found to be relatively low. Using ab initio molecular dynamics simulations, we predict that 6.25\% Si-doped c-Na3PS4 has a Na+ conductivity of 1.66 mS/cm, in excellent agreement with previous experimental results. Remarkably, we find that Sn4+ doping at the same concentration yields a much higher predicted Na+ conductivity of 10.7 mS/cm, though with a higher dopant formation energy. A higher Si4+ doping concentration of x = 0.125 also yields a significant increase in Na+ conductivity with an even higher dopant formation energy. Finally, topological and van Hove correlation function analyses suggest that the channel volume and correlation in Na+ motions may play important roles in enhancing Na+ conductivity in this structure.},

In this work, we investigate the diffusion barriers for lithium ions in two different crystal structures of LTO using the density functional theory. Our calculations show that the activation barriers vary between 0.30\textendash 0.48 eV for the spinel phase Li4Ti5O12 and between 0.20\textendash 0.51 eV in the lithiated rocksalt phase Li7Ti5O12. The origins of the rather broad ranges of activation energies are related to different chemical environments of the diffusion channels due to mixed occupancies of some sites in LTO. Our results reveal that the determination of lithium diffusion constants in LTO can not be carried out by using a single activation barrier. Instead, the local environment of the diffusion paths must be considered to correctly capture the variety of activation barriers. Moreover, we find the sites which have mixed occupation in LTO to trap lithium vacancies in the spinel phase. This effect is not observed in the rocksalt phase. This behavior explains the low lithium diffusivity found in experiments for lithium concentrations in the vicinity of the spinel phase.}

Herein, a systematic approach is proposed for locating reaction paths that bypasses the required human effort and expands the reactive search space, all while maintaining low computational cost. To achieve this, a range of intermediates are generated that represent potential single elementary steps away from a starting structure. These structures are then screened to identify those that are thermodynamically accessible, and then feasible reaction paths to the remaining structures are located. This strategy for elementary reaction path finding is independent of atomistic model whenever bond breaking and forming are properly described. The approach is demonstrated to work well for upper main group elements, but this limitation can easily be surpassed. Further extension will allow discovery of multistep reaction mechanisms in a single computation. The method is highly parallel, allowing for effective use of modern large-scale computational clusters.},

  abstract = {Structure\textendash property relationships form the basis of many design rules in materials science, including synthesizability and long-term stability of catalysts, control of electrical and opto-electronic behavior in semiconductors, as well as the capacity of and transport properties in cathode materials for rechargeable batteries. The immediate atomic environments (i.e., the first coordination shells) of a few atomic sites are often a key factor in achieving a desired property. Some of the most frequently encountered coordination patterns are tetrahedra, octahedra, body and face-centered cubic as well as hexagonal close packed-like environments. Here, we showcase the usefulness of local order parameters to identify these basic structural motifs in inorganic solid materials by developing classification criteria. We introduce a systematic testing framework, the Einstein crystal test rig, that probes the response of order parameters to distortions in perfect motifs to validate our approach. Subsequently, we highlight three important application cases. First, we map basic crystal structure information of a large materials database in an intuitive manner by screening the Materials Project (MP) database (61,422 compounds) for element-specific motif distributions. Second, we use the structure-motif recognition capabilities to automatically find interstitials in metals, semiconductor, and insulator materials. Our Interstitialcy Finding Tool (InFiT) facilitates high-throughput screenings of defect properties. Third, the order parameters are reliable and compact quantitative structure descriptors for characterizing diffusion hops of intercalants as our example of magnesium in MnO 2 -spinel indicates. Finally, the tools developed in our work are readily and freely available as software implementations in the pymatgen library, and we expect them to be further applied to machine-learning approaches for emerging applications in materials science.},

  abstract = {Surface segregation\textemdash the enrichment of one element at the surface, relative to the bulk\textemdash is ubiquitous to multi-component materials. Using the example of a Cu\textendash Au solid solution, we demonstrate that compositional variations induced by surface segregation are accompanied by misfit strain and the formation of dislocations in the subsurface region via a surface diiusion and trapping process. The resulting chemically ordered surface regions acts as an eeective barrier that inhibits subsequent dislocation annihilation at free surfaces. Using dynamic, atomic-scale resolution electron microscopy observations and theory modelling, we show that the dislocations are highly active, and we delineate the specific atomic-scale mechanisms associated with their nucleation, glide, climb, and annihilation at elevated temperatures. These observations provide mechanistic detail of how dislocations nucleate and migrate at heterointerfaces in dissimilar-material systems. A lloying is an established and versatile method to tune the properties of materials, including mechanical strength, ductility and toughness, corrosion resistance, and catalytic properties. Often, minor compositional modifications that occur locally in a material can lead to drastic changes in properties: at free surfaces these changes can affect corrosion resistance and catalytic function; at grain boundaries they influence fracture strength; at dislocations they alter plastic deformation behaviour; and at heterophase interfaces they affect adhesion and integrity 1\textendash 3 . Thus, the effects of variations in alloy composition can easily manifest themselves in the macroscopic world through the localized phenomena of segregation\textemdash that is, the enrichment of a material constituent at a free external surface or an internal interface. Because most engineered materials are alloys either by design or by the natural incorporation of impurities that remain after processing, segregation phenomena are of fundamental scientific interest and have enormous consequence across many materials technologies. Here we report that atomic segregation acts as a source for generating dislocations, a phenomenon that has not been recognized due to the difficulty of probing the fast dynamics of the local atomic configurations. The use of real-time transmission electron microscopy (TEM) allows us to both spatially and temporally resolve the transition of the coherent, dislocation-free interface between a Cu 3 Au-segregated surface and a Cu(Au) crystal substrate into a semi-coherent structure through the nucleation and subsequent migration of misfit accommodating dislocations. By combining these atomic-resolution observations with density functional theory (DFT) and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, we have identified a mechanism by which atomic segregation facilitates the nucleation of dislocations at alloy surfaces. This observed coupling between segregation and dislocation formation has wide relevance, as the partitioning of alloying elements (or impurities) occurs in most multi-component materials under a suitable environmental bias. Thus, the phenomena reported here are of considerable practical importance for a wide range of material systems, properties, and reactions, which include metallurgy, nanostructure synthesis, mechanical properties, oxidation/reduction, and heterogeneous catalysis. The Cu\textendash Au alloy system is a model system for studying surface segregation in metal-based alloys because Cu and Au form a face-centred cubic (fcc) solid solution over a wide range of composition and temperature},

Using this approach to significantly improve the accuracy of ML-predicted formation energies and elastic moduli of hypothetical crystals, two novel ultra-incompressible hard MoWC 2 (P6 3 =mmc) and ReWB (Pca2 1 ) were identified and successfully synthesized via in situ reactive spark plasma sintering from screening 399,960 transition metal borides and carbides. This work addresses a critical bottleneck to accurate property predictions for hypothetical materials, paving the way to ML-accelerated discovery of new materials with exceptional properties.},

  abstract = {Machine learning of the quantitative relationship between local environment descriptors and the potential energy surface of a system of atoms has emerged as a new frontier in the development of interatomic potentials (IAPs). Here, we present a comprehensive evaluation of machine learning IAPs (ML-IAPs) based on four local environment descriptors - atom-centered symmetry functions (ACSF), smooth overlap of atomic positions (SOAP), the spectral neighbor analysis potential (SNAP) bispectrum components, and moment tensors - using a diverse data set generated using high-throughput density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The data set comprising bcc (Li, Mo) and fcc (Cu, Ni) metals and diamond group IV semiconductors (Si, Ge) is chosen to span a range of crystal structures and bonding. All descriptors studied show excellent performance in predicting energies and forces far surpassing that of classical IAPs, as well as predicting properties such as elastic constants and phonon dispersion curves. We observe a general trade-off between accuracy and the degrees of freedom of each model and, consequently, computational cost. We will discuss these trade-offs in the context of model selection for molecular dynamics and other applications.},
