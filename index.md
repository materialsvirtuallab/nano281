# NANOx81 - Data Science in Materials Science

Welcome to the UCSD Course NANO 181/281 ("x81") - Data Science in Materials Science. NANOx81 is a co-scheduled 
course for both undergraduates and graduate students. The aim is to provide a comprehensive introduction to the 
application of data science to materials science. The full syllabus is available [here](syllabus).

## Jupyter Notebooks

In-lecture demos will be conducted using Jupyter notebooks, available [here](https://github.com/materialsvirtuallab/nano281/tree/master/lectures/notebooks).

# Labs

There are three lab sessions. The instructions for the first two labs are available via the menu on the left. The 
final lab will be an open problem that will be determined at a later date and will be held via a Kaggle competition.

# Course textbooks

The course is intended to be self-contained and all textbooks are optional.
However, the following are useful to have around:

1. The Elements of Statistical Learning: Data Mining, Inference, and Prediction,
   Second Edition [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0387848576/ref=cm_sw_em_r_mt_dp_U_Z8r8DbR3HMYRE),
   or get the [free online version](https://web.stanford.edu/~hastie/Papers/ESLII.pdf).
2. Python Data Science Handbook. Buy from [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1491912057/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) 
   or get the [free online version](https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook/).

# Programming language

All lectures and labs will be conducted in Python 3.9+. For most students, especially those that are new to python, you 
can simply use [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) to run all lecture notebooks and do all labs.

The main disadvantage of Google Colab is that you have to work in the cloud and often, the compute resources 
provided will not be as fast as running things on your laptop or any high performance computing system of your 
choosing. For serious work, you can follow the [instructions provided](setup) to install Python and 
the necessary libraries for this course.
