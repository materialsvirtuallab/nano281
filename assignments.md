# Labs

NANOx81 is evaluated via three labs.

Lab 1 - 25% of total grade
Lab 2 - 25% of total grade
Lab 3 - 50% of total grade

Labs 1 and 2 have already been posted. Lab 3 will be an open problem, i.e., even your instructors have no idea of
the correct solution, and will be held as a Kaggle competition.

# Exercises

Exercises are ungraded and are meant to help reinforce various concepts in the course. While they are optional, they
are highly recommended. **In particular, all students should attempt Exercise 1.** If you are not able to complete
Exercise 1 in a reasonable timeframe or quality, it may mean you are not ready for this course and should consider
dropping it early.
